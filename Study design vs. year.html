        <p>Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and web-based applications in a
          way that makes them usable and accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. This includes
          ensuring that web content can be easily understood, navigated, and interacted with by people with a wide range
          of abilities and disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

        <p>This Eppi Mapper generated map conforms to the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility
          Guidelines (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">W3C WCAG</a>) Version
          2.1 Level AA to the maximum extent possible. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible
          for people with disabilities. The features in this map include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the default settings have been used when generating this map, the overall colour design has been set to
            a more visually contrasting appearance.</li>
          <li>Links in the application have been converted to buttons to accommodate screen readers.</li>
          <li>Aria status updates now inform screen readers when modals open and selected records change.</li>
          <li>Tab focus is contained within opened modals.</li>
          <li>The style selection functionality has been moved to the top menu for easier access.</li>
          <li>A new style, Textual view, has been added to the map. This view presents the record counts within each
            node in a text readable format.</li>
          <li>URL links for individual records have been made descriptive.</li>
          <li>The map generation tool will inform the user if the selected background and font colour contrast meet
            accessibility requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
        <p>At the present time, while the keyboard focus does stay within each opened modal, the focus cannot be moved
          to individual checkboxes or radio buttons or, in the View Records modal, to all fields in the full record.
          This means that those items, along with the nodes in the map, can only be selected using a mouse or pointing
          device. In future updates we hope to address this limitation.</p>

We aim to systematically review the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine initiation that aims to omit prerequisite withdrawal. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE and CENTRAL from 1996 through April 10, 2020, augmented with searches in Google Scholar and www.clinicaltrials.gov . A study was included if it was in patients with substance use disorder or chronic pain that were taking a full mu opioid agonist and transitioning to buprenorphine without preceding withdrawal, and reported withdrawal during initiation as an outcome. Two investigators independently screened citations and articles for inclusion, collected data using a standardized data collection tool, and assessed study risk of bias. RESULTS: We included 15 case reports/series, reporting 24 unique cases, in our qualitative synthesis. No controlled studies were identified. Microdosing and bridging with a buprenorphine patch were the most common strategies reported. Transition to buprenorphine with complete cessation of opioid agonists was achieved in 87.5% (n = 21) of cases. Withdrawal during initiation occurred in 58.3% (n = 14) of cases, two of which were at least moderate in severity. CONCLUSION: Buprenorphine initiation strategies that omit prerequisite withdrawal have emerged. Low quality evidence from case reports suggests withdrawal during initiation is common but most often mild in severity. There is an unmet need for controlled studies to inform their efficacy and safety compared with traditional strategies, including outcomes during initiation and in the long-term.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adams KK ; Machnicz M ; Sobieraj DM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13722-021-00244-8 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nInitiation\r\nMicrodosing\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nWithdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adams KK, Machnicz M, and Sobieraj DM (2021) Initiating buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder without prerequisite withdrawal: a systematic review..

The COVID-19 pandemic shifted the perceived risks and benefits of daily clinic attendance and led to widespread policy reform, creating an unprecedented opportunity to explore the impact of more flexible prescribing. We conducted a qualitative systematic review to synthesize the evidence on providers’ experiences with relaxing restrictions on take-home doses of medications prescribed for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The protocol for this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022360589; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/). From Sept.–Nov. 2022, we searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and the grey literature from 2020 onward. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used qualitative methods to investigate providers’ experiences with relaxed restrictions on take-home medications for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. We appraised study quality using the CASP qualitative checklist and used thematic synthesis and GRADE-CERQual to synthesize the results. Results: We retrieved 13 articles representing 11 studies. Six were conducted in the United States and most focused on changes to methadone treatment. Providers’ experiences with increased flexibilities around take-homes were broadly positive, despite widespread initial concern over client safety and the potential for medication misuse. For a small number of providers, concerns about diversion were a specific manifestation of more general unease with loss of control over clients and the treatment process. Most providers appreciated increased flexibilities and described them as enabling more individualized, person-centered care. Conclusion: Our findings support the continuation of flexibilities around take-homes and demonstrate that regulations and policies that reduce flexibility around take-homes conflict with person-centered approaches to care. Stronger guidance and support from professional regulatory agencies may help increase uptake of flexibilities around take-homes.","Comments":"2023-05-23","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Adams A ; Blawatt S ; MacDonald S ; Finnick R ; Lajeunesse J ; Harrison S ; Byres D ; Schechter M T; Oviedo-Joekes E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2023.104058","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate agonist\r\nclient centered therapy\r\nclinical protocol\r\ncoronavirus disease 2019\r\ndata base\r\ndata extraction\r\ndrug dependence treatment\r\nexperience\r\nhealth care personnel\r\nhuman\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\npandemic\r\nprescribing practice\r\nprescription\r\nprescription drug misuse\r\nqualitative analysis\r\nqualitative research\r\nquality control\r\nrelaxing restriction on take home medication\r\nreview\r\nsafety\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review\r\nthematic analysis\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Adams A, Blawatt S, MacDonald S, Finnick R, Lajeunesse J, Harrison S, Byres D, Schechter M T, and Oviedo-Joekes E (2023) Provider experiences with relaxing restrictions on take-home medications for opioid use disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative systematic review.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of intramuscular (IM) haloperidol plus midazolam on morphine analgesia among opium-dependent patients. METHODS: Opium-dependent adults who were admitted to the ED for new-onset severe pain in the limbs or abdomen (within 24 hours of admission and a pain score of over six, using a numerical rating scale [NRS]) were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups. Group A received morphine 0.05 mg/kg intravenously (IV) and a mixture of midazolam 2.5 mg and haloperidol 2.5 mg (diluted in 5 cc of distilled water, IM); group B received morphine 0.05 mg/kg IV and distilled water 5 cc, IM. Measured outcomes were related to: 1) pain intensity; 2) total doses of morphine; 3) changes in hemodynamic status and level of consciousness of patients. NRS scores (zero to 10) before and one, three and six hours following intervention, as well as total doses of morphine, were recorded. RESULTS: We recruited 68 males (78.16%) and 19 females (21.83%). The mean age was 38.28±6.59 years. The pain score in group A declined more rapidly over six hours than that in group B. Moreover, as compared to group B, the amount of morphine use decreased significantly in group A. CONCLUSION: Based on the present data, adding haloperidol plus midazolam to morphine for pain management improved pain scores and lowered morphine consumption among opium-dependent patients.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Afzalimoghaddam M ; Edalatifard M ; Nejati A ; Momeni M ; Isavi N ; Karimialavijeh E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1874473710666170106122455 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nEmergency Service, Hospital\r\nFemale\r\nHaloperidol/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMidazolam/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMorphine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*complications\r\nPain/*drug therapy\r\nPain Measurement\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAnalgesia\r\nhaloperidol\r\nmidazolam\r\nmorphine\r\nopium\r\npain management","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Afzalimoghaddam M, Edalatifard M, Nejati A, Momeni M, Isavi N, and Karimialavijeh E (2016) Midazolam Plus Haloperidol as Adjuvant Analgesics to Morphine in Opium Dependent Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial..

METHODS: Infants with intrauterine exposure to methadone or heroin and neonatal abstinence syndrome (2 consecutive modified Finnegan scores of > or =9) were enrolled at 2 hospitals during 2002-2005 and followed until final hospital discharge. All enrolled infants (80) received oral diluted tincture of opium according to a standardized algorithm and were randomly assigned to receive oral clonidine (1 microg/kg every 4 hours) (40 infants) or placebo (40 infants). Primary outcome was duration of opioid therapy. Secondary outcomes included the amount of opium required to control symptoms, number of treatment failures, and differences in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. RESULTS: The median length of therapy was 27% shorter in the clonidine group (11 [95% confidence interval: 8-15 days]) than in the placebo group (15 days [95% confidence interval: 12-17 days]). In the clonidine group, 7 infants required restarting opium after initial discontinuation versus none in the placebo group, with the total length of treatment/observation remaining significantly less in the clonidine group. Higher dosages of opium were required by 40% of the infants in the placebo group versus 20% in the clonidine group. Treatment failures occurred in 12.5% of the infants in the placebo group versus none in the clonidine group. Hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, or desaturations did not occur in either group. Three infants in the clonidine group died as a result of myocarditis, sudden infant death syndrome, and homicide, all after hospital discharge and before 6 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, double-blind trial, adding clonidine to standard opioid therapy for detoxification from in utero exposure to methadone or heroin reduced the duration of pharmacotherapy for neonatal abstinence without causing short-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A larger trial is indicated to determine long-term safety.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Agthe AG ; Kim GR ; Mathias KB ; Hendrix CW ; Chavez-Valdez R ; Jansson L ; Lewis TR ; Yaster M ; Gauda EB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1542/peds.2008-0978 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage\r\nBlood Pressure/drug effects\r\nClonidine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHeart Rate/drug effects\r\nHeroin/*adverse effects\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*adverse effects\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*drug therapy\r\nOpium/*administration & dosage\r\nProspective Studies\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Agthe AG, Kim GR, Mathias KB, Hendrix CW, Chavez-Valdez R, Jansson L, Lewis TR, Yaster M, and Gauda EB (2009) Clonidine as an adjunct therapy to opioids for neonatal abstinence syndrome: a randomized, controlled trial..

Concentrations of (R)- and (S)-methadone above therapeutic levels have the ability to cause serious, life-threatening, and fatal side effects. This toxicity can be due in part to the pharmacogenetics of an individual, which influences the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug. Methadone is primarily metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, predominately by CYP2B6, followed by CYP3A4, 2C19, 2D6, and to a lesser extent, CYP2C18, 3A7, 2C8, 2C9, 3A5, and 1A2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within CYPs have the potential to play an important role in altering methadone metabolism and pharmacodynamics. Several SNPs in the CYP2B6, 3A4, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A5 genes result in increases in methadone plasma concentrations, decreased N-demethylation, and decreased methadone clearance. In particular, carriers of CYP2B6*6/*6 may have a greater risk for detrimental adverse effects, as methadone metabolism and clearance are diminished in these individuals. CYP2B6*4, on the other hand, has been observed to decrease plasma concentrations of methadone due to increased methadone clearance. The involvement, contribution, and understanding the role of SNPs in CYP2B6, and other CYP genes, in methadone metabolism can improve the therapeutic uses of methadone in patient outcome and the development of personalized medicine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmad T ; Valentovic MA ; Rankin GO ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.bcp.2018.02.020 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nAnimals\r\nCytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*metabolism/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism\r\nPharmacogenetics/methods/*trends\r\nPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics\r\nCytochrome P450 (CYP)\r\nGenetic variant\r\nMethadone metabolism\r\nPharmacogenetics\r\nSingle nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmad T, Valentovic MA, and Rankin GO (2018) Effects of cytochrome P450 single nucleotide polymorphisms on methadone metabolism and pharmacodynamics..

This research presents the first study regarding the effectiveness of different singly administered high doses of buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist (of μ-opioid receptors), a potent opioid antagonist (of Κ-receptors) and a partial agonist of nociception receptors) in reducing suicidal ideation in acutely depressed people with co-morbid opiate dependence. It follows small studies that suggest that ultra-low-dose buprenorphine may be useful in reducing suicidal ideation. The goal of this study was to describe the outcome of different doses of buprenorphine on suicidal opioid-dependent patients over a 3-day interval, by conducting a randomized clinical trial. Methods: Fifty-one suicidal male inpatients who fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for both opioid dependence and major depressive disorder were randomized to three groups (n = 17 per group) to receive a single, sublingual dose of buprenorphine (32mg, 64mg, or 96mg). Out of 51 participants, there were 47 patients; 16 (34.04%) received 32mg, 17 (36.17%) received 64mg, and 14 (29.78%) received 96mg of sublingual buprenorphine. They were evaluated by using psychometric assessment of the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI) and interviews based on DSM-5 criteria. A placebo group was not included because of the high probability of severe withdrawal without active pharmacological treatment. The study was conducted with appropriate precautions and monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular measures. The medication was administered while the patients were in moderate opiate withdrawal, as indicated by the presence of four to five withdrawal symptoms. A structured clinical interview was conducted, and urine toxicology testing was performed. Results: Patients completed the 3-day trial course. The outcomes illustrated a significant reduction in BSSI scores within each of the three groups, p<0.01., but no difference in results between the groups, p=0.408. Conclusions: The results suggest that a single high dose of buprenorphine could rapidly treat suicidal ideations. A single high dose of buprenorphine may be a main-mechanism medication that gives a rapid treatment for suicidal opioid-dependent patients. Placebo-controlled trials are required to measure the safety and the physiological and psychological effects of this medication.","Comments":"2018-12-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmadi J ; Jahromi M S; Ehsaei Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13063-018-2843-9","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nBeck Scale for Suicidal Ideation\r\nclinical article\r\ncomorbidity\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndisease association\r\nDSM-5\r\nhuman\r\nmajor depression\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprobability\r\npsychological rating scale\r\npsychometry\r\nscoring system\r\nsingle drug dose\r\nstructured interview\r\nsuicidal ideation\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmadi J, Jahromi M S, and Ehsaei Z (2018) The effectiveness of different singly administered high doses of buprenorphine in reducing suicidal ideation in acutely depressed people with co-morbid opiate dependence: A randomized, double-blind, clinical trial.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of a single, high dose of buprenorphine on craving in opioid-dependent patients over 5 days of abstinence from use of other opioids. The primary goal was to determine the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine during withdrawal in a hospital setting. METHODS: Ninety men who used opium, heroin, or prescribed opioids and met DSM-5 criteria for opioid use disorder (severe form) were randomized to three groups (n = 30 per group) to receive a single, sublingual dose of buprenorphine (32, 64, or 96 mg).

Buprenorphine was administered when the patients were in moderate opiate withdrawal, as indicated by the presence of four to five symptoms. A structured clinical interview was conducted, and urine toxicology testing was performed at baseline. Self-reports of craving were obtained at baseline and on each of the 5 days after buprenorphine administration. FINDINGS: Craving decreased from baseline in each of the three groups (p < 0.0001), with a significant interaction between group and time (p < 0.038), indicating that groups with higher doses of buprenorphine had greater reduction.

Accordingly, to explore this possibility further, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed. Method A total of 43 patients (mean age: 34.41 years; SD = 6.58; 53.5% males) with refractory OCD and treated with SSRIs or clomipramine at therapeutic dosages were randomly assigned either to an adjuvant buprenorphine or to an adjuvant placebo condition. Patients completed the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) at baseline, weeks 3, 9 and 12 (study completion). Buprenorphine (2–4 mg; sublingual) and placebo (tablets with identical shape, color, consistency, and scent) were given daily. Results Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders decreased over time, but more so in the buprenorphine than in the placebo condition. Substantial improvements were observed up to week 3 and then 9. Response and partial response were observed in the buprenorphine at week 9 more than in the placebo condition. The advantage had disappeared by week 12. Conclusions The pattern of results suggests that adjuvant buprenorphine augmentation can reduce symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders after only three weeks, compared to a placebo. Adjuvant buprenorphine seems to accelerate symptom improvement.","Comments":"2020-10-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ahmadpanah M ; Reihani A ; Ghaleiha A ; Soltanian A ; Haghighi M ; Jahangard L ; Sadeghi Bahmani ; D  ; Holsboer-Trachsler E ; Brand S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2017.06.004","Keywords":"IRCT20150624229001N1\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncitalopram\r\nclomipramine\r\nescitalopram\r\nplacebo\r\nadjuvant therapy\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nobsessive compulsive disorder\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nstatistical distribution\r\ntreatment outcome\r\ntreatment response\r\nYale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmadpanah M, Reihani A, Ghaleiha A, Soltanian A, Haghighi M, Jahangard L, Sadeghi Bahmani, D , Holsboer-Trachsler E, and Brand S (2017) Buprenorphine augmentation improved symptoms of OCD, compared to placebo - Results from a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial.

It uses public release data from a study of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), relative to buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX). METHODS: We used publicly available data from the X:BOT trial (n = 570), which compared XR-NTX to BUP-NX on 2 efficacy outcomes (opioid relapse, use of nonprescribed opioids; positive opioid urine test) and 1 safety outcome (overdose). Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol approaches were implemented using survival models that included treatment-by-time interactions. RESULTS: Consistent with the original trial findings, 72% of XR-NTX and 94% of BUP-NX subjects initiated treatment; the ITT hazard ratio for XR-NTX relative to BUP-NX was 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.73; P < 0.01) for opioid relapse and 1.31 (1.07, 1.60; P = 0.01) for positive urine test. Using treatment-by-time interactions, we examined the time-dependent effect of XR-NTX and found an elevated ITT overdose hazard ratio of 2.4 (1.1, 5.3; P = 0.03) overall and 3.8 (1.2, 11.6; P = 0.02) during the study treatment phase. This result (28 overdoses overall; 17 overdoses during the study treatment phase) contrasts with the previous analysis, which reported minimal differences in overdose between XR-NTX and BUP-NX. CONCLUSIONS: An advantage of using time-dependent Cox models is its ability to isolate effects during specific periods. In general, our survival analyses concur with the conclusions of Lee et al (2018) for the efficacy outcomes, which demonstrated superiority of BUP-NX. In contrast to the original report, our analysis indicates a greater risk of overdose for XR-NTX, predominantly during the study treatment phase. Further investigation of this finding is a pressing research priority.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ajazi EM ; Dasgupta N ; Marshall SW ; Monaco J ; Howard AG ; Preisser JS ; Schwartz TA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000931 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\n*Drug Overdose/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nRecurrence\r\nSurvival Analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ajazi EM, Dasgupta N, Marshall SW, Monaco J, Howard AG, Preisser JS, and Schwartz TA (2022) Revisiting the X:BOT Naltrexone Clinical Trial Using a Comprehensive Survival Analysis..

Research suggests that HCV in PWID may be treated effectively, but optimal models of care for promoting adherence and sustained virologic response (SVR) have not been evaluated in the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether directly observed therapy (DOT) and group treatment (GT) are more effective than self-administered individual treatment (SIT) in promoting adherence and achieving SVR among PWID receiving OAT. DESIGN: Three-group, randomized controlled trial conducted from October 2013 to April 2017. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01857245). SETTING: Three OAT programs in Bronx, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Persons aged 18 years and older with genotype 1 HCV infection who were willing to receive HCV therapy on site in the OAT program. Of 190 persons screened, 158 were randomly assigned to a study group and 150 initiated treatment: DOT (n = 51), GT (n = 48), and SIT (n = 51). INTERVENTION: 2 intensive interventions (DOT and GT) and 1 control condition (SIT). MEASUREMENTS: Primary: adherence, measured by using electronic blister packs. Secondary: HCV treatment completion and SVR 12 weeks after treatment completion. RESULTS: Mean age was 51 years; 65% of participants had positive results on urine drug testing during the 6 months before treatment, and 75% reported ever injecting drugs. Overall adherence, estimated from mixed-effects models using the daily timeframe, was 78% (95% CI, 75% to 81%) and was greater among participants randomly assigned to DOT (86% [CI, 80% to 92%]) than those assigned to SIT (75% [CI, 70% to 81%]; difference, 11% [CI, 5% to 18%]; Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.001). No significant difference in adherence was observed between participants randomly assigned to GT (80% [CI, 74% to 86%]) and those assigned to SIT (difference, 4.7% [CI, -2% to 11%]; Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.29). The HCV treatment completion rate was 97%, with no differences among groups (P = 0.53). Overall SVR was 94% (CI, 89% to 97%); the SVR rate was 98% in the DOT group, 94% in the GT group, and 90% in the SIT group (P = 0.152). LIMITATION: These findings may not be generalizable to PWID not enrolled in OAT programs. CONCLUSION: All models of onsite HCV care delivered to PWID in OAT programs resulted in high SVR, despite ongoing drug use. Directly observed therapy was associated with greater adherence than SIT.

METHODS: PREVAIL was a randomized controlled trial that assessed models of HCV care for 150 PWID on OAT. Those who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) (n = 141; 94%) were eligible for this extension study. Interviews and assessments of recurrent HCV viremia occurred at 6-month intervals for up to 24 months following PREVAIL. We used survival analysis to analyze variables associated with time to reinfection. RESULTS: Of 141 who achieved SVR, 114 had a least 1 visit in the extension study (62% male; mean age, 52 years). Injection drug use (IDU) was reported by 19% (n = 22) in the extension study. HCV reinfection was observed in 3 participants. Over 246 person-years of follow-up, the incidence of reinfection was 1.22/100 person-years (95% CI, 0.25-3.57). All reinfections occurred among participants reporting ongoing IDU. The incidence of reinfection in participants reporting ongoing IDU (41 person-years of follow-up) was 7.4/100 person-years (95% CI, 1.5-21.6). Reinfection was associated with reporting ongoing IDU in the follow-up period (P < .001), a lack confidence in the ability to avoid contracting HCV (P < .001), homelessness (P = .002), and living with a PWID (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: HCV reinfection was low overall, but more common among people with ongoing IDU following DAA therapy on OAT, as well as those who were not confident in the ability to avoid contracting HCV, homeless, or living with a PWID. Interventions to mediate these risk factors following HCV therapy are warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Akiyama MJ ; Lipsey D ; Heo M ; Agyemang L ; Norton BL ; Hidalgo J ; Lora K ; Litwin AH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/cid/ciz693 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHepacivirus\r\n*Hepatitis C/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\n*Hepatitis C, Chronic/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Pharmaceutical Preparations\r\nRecurrence\r\nReinfection\r\n*Substance Abuse, Intravenous/complications/drug therapy\r\nHCV\r\nDAA\r\nIDU\r\nPWID\r\nreinfection","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Akiyama MJ, Lipsey D, Heo M, Agyemang L, Norton BL, Hidalgo J, Lora K, and Litwin AH (2020) Low Hepatitis C Reinfection Following Direct-acting Antiviral Therapy Among People Who Inject Drugs on Opioid Agonist Therapy..

Naltrexone is an antagonist that blocks opioid effects and could be an effective medication for the treatment of opioid dependence. However, its clinical utility has been limited partly because of poor adherence and acceptability. Given the importance of compliance to naltrexone treatment for opioid dependence, the goal of the current study was to examine predictors involved in successful induction onto naltrexone treatment. METHOD: Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were performed on data from a sample of 64 individuals entering treatment who met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. The relationship between naltrexone induction (ie, inducted vs not inducted onto naltrexone) and risk-taking propensity, as indexed by riskiness on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), was examined. Participants were recruited from local detoxification programs, inpatient drug treatment, and other Baltimore programs that provided services to opioid-dependent adults (eg, Baltimore Needle Exchange Program) during the period from August 2007 to September 2008. RESULTS: Positive association was shown between risk-taking propensity and odds of naltrexone induction. Specifically, each 5-point increase in the total BART score was associated with a 25% decrease in odds of naltrexone induction (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99; P = .041). This association remained statistically significant, even after adjusting for potential confounds, including injection drug use and cocaine positive urine results (P = .05). After adjusting for the covariates, each 5-point increase in BART score was associated with 28% decrease in the odds of achieving the maintenance dose (adjusted OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.99; P = .046). CONCLUSIONS: Risk-taking propensity was predictive of induction onto naltrexone treatment, above and beyond injection drug use and cocaine-positive urine samples.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aklin WM ; Severtson SG ; Umbricht A ; Fingerhood M ; Bigelow GE ; Lejuez CW ; Silverman K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4088/JCP.09m05807 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nBaltimore\r\nCocaine-Related Disorders/psychology/rehabilitation\r\nConditioning, Operant\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/psychology/rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/psychology\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care/*psychology\r\nPersonality Assessment/statistics & numerical data\r\nPsychometrics\r\nRehabilitation, Vocational\r\n*Risk-Taking\r\nSheltered Workshops\r\nSubstance Abuse Detection\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/psychology/rehabilitation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aklin WM, Severtson SG, Umbricht A, Fingerhood M, Bigelow GE, Lejuez CW, and Silverman K (2012) Risk-taking propensity as a predictor of induction onto naltrexone treatment for opioid dependence..

AIM: The current study is the first research that reviewed the prevalence of methamphetamine dependence and the associated harms among Iranian methadone patients. The other aims were to review the history of receiving methamphetamine treatment among methadone patients and the evaluated psychosocial treatments for methamphetamine dependence and/or associated harms. METHODS: Searching included both peer-reviewed literature and grey literature in English and Persian. Reference lists of the relevant papers and reports were searched manually for more information. The time period between 1 January 2005 and 28 October 2017 was set for searching. FINDINGS: Available evidence indicated that methamphetamine dependence increased from 3.9% among the two genders in 2007 to 60.3% among men in 2014 and 89.5% among women in 2015-2016. The prevalence of methamphetamine dependence was higher among female methadone patients than their male counterparts. Methamphetamine dependence was associated with multiple health problems in the social and health contexts of the two genders especially women. However, receiving methamphetamine treatment was negligible. The review indicated that cognitive-behavioural therapy improved psychological well-being. The Matrix Model led to abstinence from methamphetamine and improved psychological well-being. Motivational interviewing increased attendance in treatment. Family therapy improved the quality of life and social support. However, more similar studies were needed. CONCLUSION: Despite a serious increase in methamphetamine dependence, there were a few evaluated psychosocial treatments. There is an immediate need to evaluate efficacious psychosocial treatments especially for women. Methamphetamine treatment should be provided in methadone treatment services.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alammehrjerdi Z ; Ezard N ; Dolan K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajp.2018.01.001 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmphetamine-Related Disorders/*epidemiology\r\nCentral Nervous System Stimulants/*adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIran/epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMethamphetamine/*adverse effects\r\nMotivational Interviewing/*methods\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nCognitive-behavioural therapy\r\nDependence\r\nMethamphetamine\r\nTreatment\r\nWomen","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alammehrjerdi Z, Ezard N, and Dolan K (2018) Methamphetamine dependence in methadone treatment services in Iran: the first literature review of a new health concern..

The standard of care for OUD involves treatment using medications such as buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. No known review exists to assess the contextual factors associated with medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the Arab World. This systematic review serves as an implementation science study to address this research gap and improve the uptake of MOUD in the Arab World. Methods: Systematic searches of Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE, and a citation analysis, were used to identify peer-reviewed articles with original data on MOUD in the Arab World. Quality assessment was conducted using the CASP appraisal tools, and main findings were extracted and coded according to the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Results: 652 research articles were identified, and 10 met inclusion criteria for final review. Four studies considered health-systems aspects of MOUD administration, such as cost-effectiveness, the motivations for and impact of national MOUD policies, the types of social, political, and scientific advocacy that led to the adoption of MOUD in Arab countries, and the challenges limiting its wide-scale adoption in the Arab World. Six papers considered MOUD at individual and group patient levels by evaluating patient quality of life, addiction severity, patient satisfaction, and patient perspectives on opioid agonist therapy. Conclusion: Despite financial and geographic barriers that limit access to MOUD in the Arab World, this review found MOUD to be cost-effective and associated with positive health outcomes for OUD patients in the Arab World. MOUD can be successfully established and scaled to the national level in the Arab context, and strong coalitions of health practitioners can lobby to establish MOUD programs in Arab countries. Still, the relative novelty of MOUD in this context precludes an abundance of research to address its long-term delivery in the Arab World.","Comments":"2022-03-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alawa J ; Muhammad M ; Kazemitabar M ; Bromberg D J; Garcia D ; Khoshnood K ; Ghandour L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103617","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nopiate agonist\r\nadoption\r\nArab world\r\nclinical evaluation\r\ncost effectiveness analysis\r\ndisease severity\r\nevidence based practice\r\nhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient satisfaction\r\nperception\r\npolicy\r\nquality control\r\nquality of life\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alawa J, Muhammad M, Kazemitabar M, Bromberg D J, Garcia D, Khoshnood K, and Ghandour L (2022) Medication for opioid use disorder in the Arab World: A systematic review.

This scoping review of the original research literature describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for PWUO and identifies gaps in the literature. METHODS: This scoping review of the original research literature maps the available knowledge regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery for PWUO. We utilized the methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and content analyses methodology to characterize the current state of the literature. RESULTS: Of the 14 included studies, administrative database (n = 11), cross-sectional (n = 1) or qualitative (n = 2) studies demonstrated service gaps (n = 7), patient/provider experiences (n = 3), and patient outcomes for PWUO (n = 4). In March 2020, healthcare utilization dropped quickly, sharply increasing only for reasons of opioid overdose by May 2020. Service gaps existed in accessing treatment for new patients during the pandemic due to capacity and infrastructure limits. Physicians reported difficulty referring patients to begin an outpatient opioid treatment program due to increased restrictions in capacity and infrastructure. Patients also reported uncertainty about accessing outpatient treatment, but that telehealth initiation of buprenorphine increased access to treatment from home. Disproportionate increases in overdose rates among African Americans were reported in two studies, with differences by race and gender not examined in most studies. Fatal overdoses increased 60% in African Americans during the pandemic, while fatal overdoses in Non-Hispanic White individuals decreased. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this beginning evidence demonstrates that despite early reluctance to use the healthcare system, opioid overdose-related use of healthcare increased throughout the pandemic. Service delivery for medications to treat OUD remained at or above pre-pandemic levels, indicating the ability of telehealth to meet demand. Yet, racial disparities that existed pre-pandemic for PWUO are intensifying, and targeted intervention for high-risk groups is warranted to prevent further mortality. As the pandemic progresses, future research must focus on identifying and supporting subgroups of PWUO who are at heightened risk for experiencing negative outcomes and lack of access to care.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alexander K ; Pogorzelska-Maziarz M ; Gerolamo A ; Hassen N ; Kelly EL ; Rising KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13011-021-00395-6 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nCOVID-19/*epidemiology\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nDrug Overdose/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality\r\nEmergency Medical Services/statistics & numerical data\r\nHealth Services Accessibility/*organization & administration\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nPandemics\r\nPatient Satisfaction\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nTelemedicine/organization & administration\r\nHealthcare delivery\r\nOpioid use\r\nPandemic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alexander K, Pogorzelska-Maziarz M, Gerolamo A, Hassen N, Kelly EL, and Rising KL (2021) The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare delivery for people who use opioids: a scoping review..

METHODS: Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) integrative review methodology guided the review process. The authors searched PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and OVID databases for peer-reviewed, English language articles describing nursing care for people receiving medications for OUD. The literature search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 773 articles were identified through the database searches after duplicates were removed; 15 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review from the United States, Canada, Ireland, England, and the Netherlands. Two themes emerged: (1) The effect of nurse-led care on patient outcomes and (2) Nursing roles and the environment of care. Studies emphasized the aspects of nursing care that promote patient-centeredness and patient satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of the registered nurse in providing quality care for people receiving medications for OUD is clear from the literature reviewed. The studies in the review highlighted important aspects of the registered nurses' role in affecting outcomes for people receiving medications for OUD including communication and care coordination. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This review highlights the need for role delineation and further development of nurse-sensitive indicators in the OUD treatment setting.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alexander K ; Smith JM ; Gerolamo A ; Bernhardt J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jnu.12858 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Nurses\r\nQuality of Health Care\r\nNurse's Role\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nOutcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nhealthcare outcomes\r\nmedication-assisted treatment\r\nmethadone\r\nnurse-led interventions\r\nnursing practice\r\nnursing role\r\nopioid use disorder\r\npatient outcomes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alexander K, Smith JM, Gerolamo A, and Bernhardt J (2023) The impact of nursing on health outcomes of people receiving medication for opioid use disorder: An integrative review..

Increased use of methadone has resulted in an increased prevalence of its toxicity, one aspect of which is cardiotoxicity. In this paper, we review the effects of methadone on the heart as well as cardiac concerns in some special situations such as pregnancy and childhood. Methods: We searched for the terms methadone, toxicity, poisoning, cardiotoxicity, heart, dysrhythmia, arrhythmia, QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) in bibliographical databases including TUMS digital library, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. This review includes relevant articles published between 2000 and 2013. The main cardiac effects of methadone include prolongation of QT interval and torsade de pointes. Other effects include changes in QT dispersion, pathological U waves, Taku-Tsubo syndrome (stress cardiomyopathy), Brugada-like syndrome, and coronary artery diseases. The aim of this paper is to inform physicians and health care staff about these adverse effects. Effectiveness of methadone in the treatment of pain and addiction should be weighed against these adverse effects and physicians should consider the ways to lessen such undesirable effects. This article presents some recommendations to prevent heart toxicity in methadone users.","Comments":"2015-06-03","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alinejad S ; Kazemi T ; Zamani N ; Hoffman R S; Mehrpour O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.17179/excli2014-553","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ncharcoal\r\nmagnesium\r\nmethadone\r\npotassium\r\nBrugada syndrome\r\ncardiotoxicity\r\nchildhood disease\r\ncoronary artery disease\r\ncoronary hemodynamics\r\ndefibrillation\r\ndose response\r\ndrug contraindication\r\ndrug indication\r\ndrug safety\r\nelectrocardiogram\r\nheart muscle potential\r\nheart ventricle bigeminy\r\nhuman\r\nhypokalemia\r\nnonhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain\r\npregnancy\r\nQT dispersion\r\nQT interval\r\nQT prolongation\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy\r\ntorsade de pointes\r\nU wave","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alinejad S, Kazemi T, Zamani N, Hoffman R S, and Mehrpour O (2015) A systematic review of the cardiotoxicity of methadone.

Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the currently available research on the role of physical activity in opioid substitution therapy and proper adaptions for the group. Methods: A systematic search was performed on PsycINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science until September 2021 (PROSPERO-reg.no: CRD42020109873). The inclusion criteria were studies involving physical activity interventions for opioid substitution patients. Reference lists of relevant studies were screened to identify additional relevant studies. Data extracted were compiled into tables and descriptively presented. Results: The search yielded 2105 unique records. A total of 10 studies were included, whose methodological quality ranged from satisfactory to very good. Study quality was assessed using a 7-/8-point quality score. The agreement between the reviewers, assessed with Cohen’s kappa, was 0.91. Overall, the results suggest that physical activity increases physical fitness of patients in opioid substitution therapy and decreases substance use. The minority of studies in this field are of high quality with sufficient power. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest beneficial effects of physical activity on physical fitness, substance use, and mental health for patients in opioid substitution therapy. Although the findings are quite consistent across studies, high-quality studies and sufficiently powered clinical trials are needed to confirm and validate the findings and to conclude on the degree of impact.","Comments":"2023-02-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alpers S E; Furulund E ; Pallesen S ; Mamen A ; Dyrstad S M; Fadnes L T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/11782218221111840","Keywords":"NCT00790569\r\nNCT03022890\r\nactivity tracker\r\ncocaine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\naerobic exercise\r\nanxiety\r\nbadminton\r\nboxing\r\nclimbing\r\ncocaine dependence\r\ncool down\r\ndancing\r\ndepression\r\ndrug dependence\r\nfitness\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhigh intensity exercise\r\nhuman\r\nmental health\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nphysical activity\r\npsychotherapy\r\nresistance training\r\nreview\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review\r\nwalking\r\nyoga","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alpers S E, Furulund E, Pallesen S, Mamen A, Dyrstad S M, and Fadnes L T (2022) The Role of Physical Activity in Opioid Substitution Therapy: A Systematic Review of Interventional and Observational Studies.

METHODS: HIV-infected, opioid-dependent subjects (N = 295) recruited from 10 clinical sites initiated buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) and were assessed at baseline and quarterly for 12 months. Primary outcomes included receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 RNA suppression, and mean changes in CD4 lymphocyte count. Analyses were stratified for the 119 subjects not on ART at baseline. Generalized estimating equations were deployed to examine time-dependent correlates for each outcome. RESULTS: At baseline, subjects on ART (N = 176) were more likely than those not on ART (N = 119) to be older, heterosexual, have lower alcohol addiction severity scores, and lower HIV-1 RNA levels; they were less likely to be homeless and report sexual risk behaviors. Subjects initiating BUP/NX (N = 295) were significantly more likely to initiate or remain on ART and improve CD4 counts over time compared with baseline; however, these improvements were not significantly improved by longer retention on BUP/NX. Retention on BUP/NX for three or more quarters was, however, significantly associated with increased likelihood of initiating ART (β = 1.34 [1.18, 1.53]) and achieve viral suppression (β = 1.25 [1.10, 1.42]) for the 64 of 119 (54%) subjects not on ART at baseline compared with the 55 subjects not retained on BUP/NX. In longitudinal analyses, being on ART was positively associated with increasing time of observation from baseline and higher mental health quality of life scores (β = 1.25 [1.06, 1.46]) and negatively associated with being homo- or bisexual (β = 0.55 [0.35, 0.97]), homeless (β = 0.58 [0.34, 0.98]), and increasing levels of alcohol addiction severity (β = 0.17 [0.03, 0.88]). The strongest correlate of achieving viral suppression was being on ART (β = 10.27 [5.79, 18.23]). Female gender (β = 1.91 [1.07, 3.41]), Hispanic ethnicity (β = 2.82 [1.44, 5.49]), and increased general health quality of life (β = 1.02 [1.00,1.04]) were also independently correlated with viral suppression. Improvements in CD4 lymphocyte count were significantly associated with being on ART and increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating BUP/NX in HIV clinical care settings is feasible and correlated with initiation of ART and improved CD4 lymphocyte counts. Longer retention on BPN/NX was not associated with improved prescription of ART, viral suppression, or CD4 lymphocyte counts for the overall sample in which the majority was already prescribed ART at baseline. Among those retained on BUP/NX, HIV treatment outcomes did not worsen and were sustained. Increasing time on BUP/NX, however, was especially important for improving HIV treatment outcomes for those not on ART at baseline, the group at highest risk for clinical deterioration. Retaining subjects on BUP/NX is an important goal for sustaining HIV treatment outcomes for those on ART and improving them for those who are not. Comorbid substance use disorders (especially alcohol), mental health problems, and quality-of-life indicators independently contributed to HIV treatment outcomes among HIV-infected persons with opioid dependence, suggesting the need for multidisciplinary treatment strategies for this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Altice FL ; Bruce RD ; Lucas GM ; Lum PJ ; Korthuis PT ; Flanigan TP ; Cunningham CO ; Sullivan LE ; Vergara-Rodriguez P ; Fiellin DA ; Cajina A ; Botsko M ; Nandi V ; Gourevitch MN ; Finkelstein R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/QAI.0b013e318209751e ","Keywords":"Alcoholism\r\nAnti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination\r\nCD4 Lymphocyte Count\r\nFemale\r\nHIV Infections/*complications/drug therapy\r\nHIV-1/metabolism\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaloxone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*complications/drug therapy\r\nRNA, Viral/blood\r\nRisk Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Altice FL, Bruce RD, Lucas GM, Lum PJ, Korthuis PT, Flanigan TP, Cunningham CO, Sullivan LE, Vergara-Rodriguez P, Fiellin DA, Cajina A, Botsko M, Nandi V, Gourevitch MN, and Finkelstein R (2011) HIV treatment outcomes among HIV-infected, opioid-dependent patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone treatment within HIV clinical care settings: results from a multisite study..

DESIGN: Phase 4, prospective, randomized, active-drug controlled, parallel-group trial consisting of a 2-day, double-blind, double-dummy induction phase followed by 26 days of open-label treatment with BNX. SETTING: Nineteen sites in 10 European countries from March 2008 to December 2009. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 187 opioid-dependent men and women ≥ 15 years of age. MEASUREMENTS: The primary objective was assessment of patient response to direct and indirect BNX induction [proportion of patients receiving the scheduled 16-mg BNX dose on day 3 (i.e. first day post-induction)]. Secondary assessments included illicit drug use, treatment retention and compliance, withdrawal scale scores, and safety. FINDINGS: Patient response to direct- versus indirect-BNX induction was similar [direct 91.4% (85/93) versus indirect 90.4% (85/94); 95% confidence interval (CI): -7.3%, 9.2%]. Rapid dose induction (16 mg of BPN equivalent on day 2) was acceptable and 72% of patients completed treatment (day 28). There were no significant differences in secondary measures across groups. An average BNX maintenance dose of 15.3 mg across groups was associated with substantial reductions in illicit opioid use and no self-reported intravenous misuse. Treatment compliance and retention rates were similar (98.5% and 81.3%, respectively). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates were comparable: 75% versus 74% for direct- versus indirect-induction groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction was a safe and effective strategy for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Response to high-dose direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction appears to be similar to indirect buprenorphine-to-buprenorphine/naloxone induction and was not associated with reports of intravenous buprenorphine/naloxone misuse.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amass L ; Pukeleviciene V ; Subata E ; Almeida AR ; Pieri MC ; D'Egidio P ; Stankova Z ; Costa A ; Smyth BP ; Sakoman S ; Wei Y ; Strang J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03577.x ","Keywords":"Administration, Sublingual\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nEurope\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInduction Chemotherapy/*methods\r\nIntention to Treat Analysis\r\nMaintenance Chemotherapy\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaloxone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*prevention & control\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amass L, Pukeleviciene V, Subata E, Almeida AR, Pieri MC, D'Egidio P, Stankova Z, Costa A, Smyth BP, Sakoman S, Wei Y, and Strang J (2012) A prospective, randomized, multicenter acceptability and safety study of direct buprenorphine/naloxone induction in heroin-dependent individuals..

These studies considered thirteen different psychosocial interventions. Comparing any psychosocial plus any maintenance pharmacological treatment to standard maintenance treatment, results do not show benefit for retention in treatment, 27 studies, 3124 participants, RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.07), abstinence by opiate during the treatment, 8 studies, 1002 participants, RR 1.12 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.37), compliance, three studies, MD 0.43 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.92), psychiatric symptoms, 3 studies, MD 0.02 (-0.28 to 0.31), depression, 3 studies, MD -1.70 (95% CI -3.91 to 0.51) and results at the end of follow up as number of participants still in treatment, 3 studies, 250 participants, RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.07) and participants abstinent by opioid, 3 studies, 181 participants, RR 1.15 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.36). Comparing the different psychosocial approaches, results are never statistically significant for all the comparisons and outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. Data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amato L ; Minozzi S ; Davoli M ; Vecchi S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD004147.pub4 ","Keywords":"Combined Modality Therapy/methods\r\nHumans\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amato L, Minozzi S, Davoli M, and Vecchi S (2011) Psychosocial combined with agonist maintenance treatments versus agonist maintenance treatments alone for treatment of opioid dependence..

Nevertheless a majority of patients relapse to heroin use, and relapses are a substantial problem in the rehabilitation of heroin users. Some studies have suggested that the sorts of symptoms which are most distressing to addicts during detoxification are psychological rather than physiological symptoms associated with the withdrawal syndrome. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of any psychosocial plus any pharmacological interventions versus any pharmacological alone for opioid detoxification, in helping patients to complete the treatment, reduce the use of substances and improve health and social status. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group trials register (June 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2011), PUBMED (1996 to June 2011); EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2011); CINAHL (January 2003 to June 2008); PsycINFO (1985 to April 2003) and reference list of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trial which focus on any psychosocial associated with any pharmacological intervention aimed at opioid detoxification. People less than 18 years of age and pregnant women were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trials quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven studies, 1592 participants, fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and were included in the review. The studies considered five different psychosocial interventions and two pharmacological treatments (methadone and buprenorphine). Compared to any pharmacological treatment alone, the association of any psychosocial with any pharmacological was shown to significantly reduce dropouts RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.85), use of opiate during the treatment, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.93), at follow up RR 0.66 (95% IC 0.53 to 0.82) and clinical absences during the treatment RR 0.48 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.59). Moreover, with the evidence currently available, there are no data supporting a single psychosocial approach. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial treatments offered in addition to pharmacological detoxification treatments are effective in terms of completion of treatment, use of opiate, participants abstinent at follow-up and clinical attendance. The evidence produced by this review is limited due to the small number of participants included in the studies, the heterogeneity of the assessment or the lack of detailed outcome information that prevented the possibility of cumulative analysis for several outcomes. Nevertheless it seems desirable to develop adjunct psychosocial approaches that might make detoxification more effective.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amato L ; Minozzi S ; Davoli M ; Vecchi S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD005031.pub4 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/rehabilitation/*therapy\r\nPsychotherapy/*methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amato L, Minozzi S, Davoli M, and Vecchi S (2011) Psychosocial and pharmacological treatments versus pharmacological treatments for opioid detoxification..

These results were confirmed also when we considered the single comparisons: methadone with: adrenergic agonists (11 studies), other opioid agonists (eight studies), anxiolytic (two studies), paiduyangsheng (one study). Comparing methadone with placebo (two studies) more severe withdrawal and more drop-outs were found in the placebo group. The results indicate that the medications used in the included studies are similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Data from literature are hardly comparable; programs vary widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures, impairing the application of meta-analysis. The studies included in this review confirm that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long- acting opioids, can reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amato L ; Davoli M ; Minozzi S ; Ferroni E ; Ali R ; Ferri M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD003409.pub4 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotics/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*rehabilitation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amato L, Davoli M, Minozzi S, Ferroni E, Ali R, and Ferri M (2013) Methadone at tapered doses for the management of opioid withdrawal..

However, many patients return to opioid use after discharge and also do not access OUD treatment. This systematic review reports on the features and findings of research on interventions developed specifically to improve substance use outcomes and treatment linkage after inpatient detoxification for OUD. METHODS: Of 6419 articles, 64 met inclusion criteria for the current review. Articles were coded on key domains including sample characteristics, study methods and outcome measures, bias indicators, intervention type, and findings. RESULTS: Many studies did not report sample characteristics, including demographics and co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders, which may impact postdetoxification OUD treatment outcomes and the generalizability of interventions. Slightly more than half of studies examined interventions that were primarily medical in nature, though only a third focused on initiating medication treatment beyond detoxification. Medical and combination interventions that focused on initiating medications for OUD generally performed well, as did psychological interventions with one or more reinforcement-based components. CONCLUSIONS: Research efforts to improve post-detoxification outcomes would benefit from clearer reporting of sample characteristics that are associated with treatment and recovery outcomes, including diagnostic comorbidities. Findings also support the need to identify ways to introduce medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and other effective treatments including reinforcement-based interventions during detoxification or soon after.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ameral V ; Hocking E ; Leviyah X ; Newberger NG ; Timko C ; Livingston N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109379 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPatient Discharge\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nCare continuity\r\nDetoxification\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nTreatment engagement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ameral V, Hocking E, Leviyah X, Newberger NG, Timko C, and Livingston N (2022) Innovating for real-world care: A systematic review of interventions to improve post-detoxification outcomes for opioid use disorder..

METHODS: For this purpose, a randomized controlled trial with a clinical basis was fulfilled on a total of 68 patients with opioid use disorder receiving MMT, allocated to two groups, viz. intervention, and control (each one consisting of 34 individuals). Then, the participants in the intervention group were given zinc supplements combined with methadone for three months, and the controls only took methadone, according to the treatment plan. The data were collected using the Relapse Prediction Scale (RPS) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) before, one month after, and at the end of the intervention program. FINDINGS: Compared to the control group, the likelihood of drug use (p = 0.01), drug craving (p = 0.002), and the RPS total score (p = 0.002) in the intervention group was significantly lower. Moreover, the results revealed a significant decreasing trend in depression (p = 0.01), anxiety (p < 0.001), stress (p = 0.001), and the DASS-21 total score (p = 0.001) in the intervention. Compared to the control group, the DASS-21 total score (p < 0.001) in the intervention group was significantly lower. CONCLUSION: Accordingly, it was concluded that zinc supplementation could reduce the PoR and improve MH problems in patients with opioid use disorder experiencing MMT.

Associated with increased length of stay and increased morbidity from withdrawal, and delirium. Buprenorphine (BPN) is a high-affinity partial mu receptor agonist with a long duration of action and indicated for both analgesia and opioid use disorder. BPN has favorable properties compared to full agonists including fewer side effects, less tolerance, and is easier to wean. The transition from full opioid agonist to buprenorphine requires a washout period to avoid precipitated withdrawal. We describe the use of BPN in 2 PICU patients using a novel method of induction called micro-dosing to simplify sedation and opioid weaning regimens. Micro-dosing, where small doses of BPN are initiated before full agonists had been stopped, allowing BPN accumulation at the receptor without precipitated withdrawal. Microinduction is considered for patients requiring high doses of opiates and at risk of withdrawal but unable to stop full agonists. DESCRIPTION: Case 1: 24 year old with global developmental delay, admitted for respiratory failure with COVID infection. Required 3-weeks sedation and attempts to wean unsuccessful. BPN was initiated over 4 days (150 mcg, 300 mcg, 1 mg, 2 mg) each dose given at 6-hour increments; the dose increased every 4 doses. Opiate agonist discontinued on day 4. They required an increase of their BPN dose two days later to 4 mg. Sedation requirements and symptoms then improved after BPN initiation. The weaning phase was completed over 9 days and did not require rescue dosing. Case 2: 13-month-old, 24-weeks premature, BPD, tracheostomy, ventilator dependence, failing sedation weans underwent micro-induction of 12.5 mcg, 30 mcg, 75 mcg, 300 mcg, 600 mcg, 1 mg, each dose given at 6-hour increments, the dose increased every 4 doses. Adjuvant medications were discontinued and weaned. She remained on full agonists concomitantly with BPN for analgesia but later tolerated weaning. DISCUSSION: BPN benefits of decreased withdrawal risk, fewer side effects, and fewer medication days can benefit the PICU population. BPN initiation in this novel way can simplify opiate weaning and lead to an improved treatment course and recovery. Further research is needed to investigate BPN in comparison to current sedation methods.","Comments":"2022-02-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Anderson J ; Chen D ; Stauber S ; Schult R ; Weigand T ; Barker E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/01.ccm.0000809820.27872.89","Keywords":"adjuvant\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nopiate\r\nopiate agonist\r\nadult\r\nanalgesia\r\ncase report\r\nclinical article\r\nconference abstract\r\ncoronavirus disease 2019\r\ndevelopmental delay\r\ndrug megadose\r\ndrug microdose\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\ninfant\r\nintermethod comparison\r\nlow drug dose\r\nopiate addiction\r\npediatric intensive care unit\r\nrespiratory failure\r\nsedation\r\nside effect\r\ntracheostomy\r\nventilator\r\nweaning\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Anderson J, Chen D, Stauber S, Schult R, Weigand T, and Barker E (2022) Use of buprenorphine microdosing for opiate dependence in the pediatric intensive care unit.

The primary objective of this phase III study was to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BUP-XR. METHODS: This open-label multicenter study in adults with moderate or severe opioid use disorder enrolled 257 participants from a previously conducted placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III study (rollover group) and 412 de novo participants not previously treated with BUP-XR. Participants received an initial injection of BUP-XR 300 mg and subsequent monthly 300 mg or 100 mg flexible doses. By study end, participants received up to 12 injections. RESULTS: Overall, 66.8% of participants reported more than 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). Injection-site TEAEs (13.2% of participants) were mostly mild or moderate in severity. There were no clinically meaningful changes in safety assessments. An integrated analysis of the double-blind and open-label study participants showed that the incidence of TEAEs, including injection-site TEAEs, was lower in the second 6 months of treatment versus the first 6 months. After 12 months of treatment, 61.5% of the rollover participants and 75.8% of the de novo participants were abstinent. Retention rates after 12 months were 50.6% for the participants who initiated BUP-XR in the double-blind study and 50.5% for de novo participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the clinical benefits and acceptable safety profile of BUP-XR demonstrated in the 6-month double-blind study are sustained over a 12-month open-label study, with lower incidence of TEAEs in the second 6 months of treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Andorn AC ; Haight BR ; Shinde S ; Fudala PJ ; Zhao Y ; Heidbreder C ; Learned SM ; Fox NL ; Nadipelli VR ; Hassman D ; Rutrick D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JCP.0000000000001195 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Subcutaneous\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Andorn AC, Haight BR, Shinde S, Fudala PJ, Zhao Y, Heidbreder C, Learned SM, Fox NL, Nadipelli VR, Hassman D, and Rutrick D (2020) Treating Opioid Use Disorder With a Monthly Subcutaneous Buprenorphine Depot Injection: 12-Month Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Analysis..

Even though the federal government recently eliminated the waiver requirement and patient limits applicable to office-based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT), among other settings, some states may still have policies imposing requirements on OBBT providers not required by federal law. METHODS: We collected statutes and regulations from 50 US states and the District of Columbia (ie, 51 jurisdictions) between August 11 and November 30, 2022 using the Nexis Uni legal database and search terms related to OBBT counseling, dosage, and/or frequency of visits. We then used template analysis, a mixed deductive-inductive qualitative method, to analyze legal content. RESULTS: Ten jurisdictions (20%) in 2022 had an OBBT counseling, dosage, and/or visit frequency requirement. Four jurisdictions had at least one law in each OBBT policy category examined. One-fifth of jurisdictions have OBBT policies not required under federal law. Five of these jurisdictions are among those with the highest overdose death rates per capita, according to publicly available data from 2021. Some OBBT requirements could potentially limit clinician interest in offering buprenorphine treatment or result in inadequate care (eg, if dosage limitations are too low.). CONCLUSIONS: Even though a federal waiver is no longer required for OBBT, our results suggests that at least some jurisdictions have other OBBT requirements, such as counseling, dosage, and/or frequency requirements. Given the severity of the ongoing opioid overdose crisis, policymakers should carefully consider the extent to which OBBT requirements are evidence based.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Andraka-Christou B ; Golan OK ; Williams M ; Buksbaum S ; Gordon AJ ; Stein BD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/29767342231223721 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Buprenorphine\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nCounseling\r\n*Drug Overdose/drug therapy\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncounseling\r\ndose\r\nlaw\r\nopioid use disorder\r\npolicy\r\nstate\r\nvisit","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Andraka-Christou B, Golan OK, Williams M, Buksbaum S, Gordon AJ, and Stein BD (2024) A Systematic Review of State Office-Based Buprenorphine Treatment Laws Effective During 2022: Counseling, Dosage, and Visit Frequency Requirements..

Orbito-frontal Cortex is implicated in the several behavioral aspects of substance use including craving. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a critical role in addictive properties of drugs of use. Previous studies have shown significant improvement in craving with RTMS and demonstrated alterations of serum BDNF levels in various substance dependent individual associated with craving. Aim: To examine the efficacy of continuous Theta Burst Stimulation RTMS (CTBS-RTMS) over the right OFC as an adjunct to Naltrexone in patients of OUD and its correlation with serum BDNF levels. Methods: Forty patients with OUD were recruited with purposive sampling. At the end of detoxification CTBS -RTMS was applied by dividing them into two equal groups as active and sham group using alternate allocation. Obsessive compulsive drug use scale (OCDUS) was applied and serum BDNF level was measured overtime till the end of CTBS-RTMS session. Data was analyzed by SPSS version 25. Results: Both groups had shown significant reduction in craving (OCDUS score) and serum BDNF from the baseline to 14th session of the RTMS. But there was no significant difference when compared between the two groups. Significant correlation was observed between serum BDNF levels overtime with different clinical variables in active group. Conclusion: The study adds to the literature in building an understanding of how rTMS could be used in reducing cravings for opioids.","Comments":"2022-06-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ankit A ; Das B ; Dey P ; Kshitiz K K; Khess C R.J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10550887.2021.2007716","Keywords":"ELISA kit\r\nbrain derived neurotrophic factor\r\nnaltrexone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbehavior disorder assessment\r\nclinical article\r\ncontinuous theta burst stimulation\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndata analysis software\r\nelectrical parameters\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmale\r\nmental disease assessment\r\nmiddle aged\r\nobjective opioid withdrawal scale\r\nobsessive compulsive drug use scale\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopoid use disorder\r\norbital cortex\r\nprospective study\r\nprotein blood level\r\nrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\r\ntherapy effect\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ankit A, Das B, Dey P, Kshitiz K K, and Khess C R.J (2022) Efficacy of continuous theta burst stimulation - repetitive trancranial magnetic stimulation on the orbito frontal cortex as an adjunct to naltrexone in patients of opioid use disorder and its correlation with serum BDNF levels: a sham-controlled study.

The opioid effect is mainly mediated by (R)-methadone, whereas (S)-methadone blocks the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) voltage-gated potassium channel more potently, which can cause drug-induced long QT syndrome, leading to potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Methods: To investigate whether substitution of (R,S)-methadone by (R)-methadone could reduce the corrected QT (QTc) interval, (R,S)-methadone was replaced by (R)-methadone (half-dose) in 39 opioid-dependent patients receiving maintenance treatment for 14 days. (R)-methadone was then replaced by the initial dose of (R,S)-methadone for 14 days (n=29). Trough (R)-methadone and (S)-methadone plasma levels and electrocardiogram measurements were taken. Results: The Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval decreased when (R,S)-methadone was replaced by a half-dose of (R)-methadone; the median (interquartile range [IQR]) values were 423 (398-440) milliseconds (ms) and 412 (395-431) ms (P=.06) at days 0 and 14, respectively.

The QTcF value increased when (R)-methadone was replaced by the initial dose of (R,S)-methadone for 14 days; median (IQR) values were 424 (398-436) ms and 424 (412-443) ms (P=.01) at days 14 and 28, respectively. The univariate model showed that the QTcF value increased by a mean of 4.7 ms (95% CI, 1.3-8.1) per week (P=.006). Conclusions: Substitution of (R,S)-methadone by (R)-methadone reduces the QTc interval value. A safer cardiac profile of (R)-methadone is in agreement with previous in vitro and pharmacogenetic studies. If the present results are confirmed by larger studies, (R)-methadone should be prescribed instead of (R,S)-methadone to reduce the risk of cardiac toxic effects and sudden death. ©2010 American Medical Association.

The medical literature supports MMT as a well established and cost-effective treatment for opioid-dependence that allows a return-to-normal physiological, psychological and societal functioning. The effectiveness of MMT is enhanced by psycho-social interventions such as contingency management and addressing other co-existing health and social needs. MMT saves lives and reduces violent and non-violent crime, drug use and the transmission of HIV, hepatitis C and other communicable diseases. For some people, MMT may continue for life, while others may eventually be able to discontinue and remain abstinent. Methadone interacts with numerous drugs and prolongs the corrected QT interval (QTc) with risk of sudden cardiac death. It has a prolonged half-life and premature discharge of patients after methadone overdose may be fatal. Each patient must be assessed, treated and monitored on an individual basis. Successful outcomes through MMT require knowledge, experience, vigilance, and diligence on the part of the physician, the patient and all of those involved in treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arora A ; Williams K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity\r\nNaloxone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arora A, and Williams K (2013) Problem based review: The patient taking methadone..

In preclinical studies, minocycline prevented development of opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). The goal of this study was to determine if minocycline changes pain threshold and tolerance in individuals with opioid use disorder who are maintained on agonist treatment. Methods: In this double-blind, randomized human laboratory study, 20 participants were randomized to either minocycline (200 mg/day) or placebo treatment for 15 days. The study had three test sessions (days 1, 8, and 15 of treatment) and one follow-up visit 1 week after the end of treatment. In each test session, participants were assessed on several subjective and cognitive measures, followed by assessment of pain sensitivity using the Cold Pressor Test (CPT). Daily surveys and cognitive measures using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) were also collected four times a day on days 8 through 14 of treatment, and proinflammatory serum cytokines were assessed before and on the last day of treatment. Results: Minocycline treatment did not change pain threshold or tolerance on the CPT. Similarly, minocycline did not change severity of pain, opioid craving, withdrawal, or serum cytokines. Minocycline treatment increased accuracy on a Go/No-Go task. Conclusions: While these findings do not support minocycline’s effects on OIH, minocycline may have a potential use as a cognitive enhancer for individuals with opioid use disorder, a finding that warrants further systematic studies.","Comments":"2019-12-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arout C A; Waters A J; MacLean R R; Compton P ; Sofuoglu M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-018-5146-7","Keywords":"buprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ninterleukin 1beta\r\ninterleukin 6\r\nmethadone\r\nminocycline\r\nopiate agonist\r\nplacebo\r\ntumor necrosis factor\r\naccuracy\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncognition\r\ncold pressor test\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug effect\r\necological momentary assessment\r\nexperimental pain\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmale\r\nnociception\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain severity\r\npain threshold\r\npriority journal\r\nprotein blood level\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsingle drug dose","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arout C A, Waters A J, MacLean R R, Compton P, and Sofuoglu M (2019) Minocycline does not affect experimental pain or addiction-related outcomes in opioid maintained patients.

Our objective was to assess outcomes of pregnant individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) taking naltrexone compared with those taking methadone or buprenorphine. DATA SOURCES: We undertook a systematic review using electronic database search (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycInfo), conference proceedings, and trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov . METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: We conducted an electronic search of research articles through May 2023 for randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies of naltrexone (oral, implant, or extended release) compared with methadone or buprenorphine (sublingual or extended release) among pregnant individuals with OUD. After double review of all articles, we abstracted obstetric (primary outcome: gestational age at delivery), neonatal (primary outcome: neonatal abstinence syndrome [NAS]), and substance use outcomes. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Five studies met eligibility criteria; four were retrospective cohort studies, and one was a prospective cohort study. Four studies included data on gestational age at delivery (weeks) with no difference detected between the two groups in any study (mean difference ranging -0.20, 95% CI, -1.49-1.09 to 0.8, 95% CI, -0.15 to 1.75). Three studies included data on NAS with all studies detecting a lower risk in the naltrexone group compared with methadone or buprenorphine (relative risk ranging from 0.08, 95% CI, 0.01-1.16 to 0.15, 95% CI, 0.06-0.36). Most studies (four of five) had a moderate or high potential for selection bias primarily driven by small sample size and lack of controlling for confounders. CONCLUSION: Although the evidence base is limited, available data suggest that naltrexone use in pregnancy is a reasonable MOUD option with reassuring perinatal outcomes. To enhance confidence in this conclusion and to assess substance use outcomes, further comparative studies of pregnant people with OUD taking naltrexone and other MOUD types are needed.

The current qualitative study sought to explore participants' attitudes to and reasons for participating in a feasibility randomised trial in primary care offering 'same day' OST (methadone) for injecting heroin users compared to usual care. METHODS: Twenty injecting heroin users (8 intervention and 12 controls; 16 males and 4 females) were interviewed; purposive sampling was used to select a maximum variation sample from those who agreed; and analysis used thematic methods. RESULTS: Motivation to join the trial included the need to secure treatment set against some ambivalence due to previous negative experiences of trying to obtain OST. Positive effects of securing methadone via the trial, included self-reported improvements in health and self-care; reduction in crime, stress and drug use. Completing the baseline questionnaires at recruitment appeared to enhance motivation for treatment for all participants. For some control participants, this motivation seemed to increase a sense of self-efficacy and cognitive dissonance generated was resolved by seeking treatment from their GP. Self-determination theory suggests that behaviour change may have been initiated during the recruitment appointment, resulting in an increased determination to seek treatment amongst control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Taking part in the 'script in a day' trial enabled participants in the intervention arm to gain same-day access to methadone and reduce their drug use. For those in the control arm, completing the baseline questionnaires at recruitment appeared to create cognitive dissonance between their current health state and own aspirations, so increasing motivation for treatment. Over 50% obtained and were still in receipt of OST (methadone or buprenorphine) at the 3 month follow-up. We suggest that a regular 'health evaluation' for injecting heroin users not in treatment, paired with low-barrier access to treatment, may be a way of exploring this and encouraging more into obtaining OST more quickly and at the best time for them. This intervention should be delivered without pressure for change.

The effects of treatment with μ opioid receptor (MOR) agonists (e.g., methadone, MET) and antagonists (e.g., naltrexone, NTX) on immune reconstitution and immune activation in ART-suppressed PLWH have not been assessed in-depth. We studied the effects of methadone or naltrexone on measures of immune reconstitution and immune activation in a cross-sectional community cohort of 30 HIV-infected individuals receiving suppressive ART and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) (12 MET, 8 NTX and 10 controls). Plasma markers of inflammation and immune activation were measured using ELISA, Luminex, or Simoa. Plasma IgG glycosylation was assessed using capillary electrophoresis. Cell subsets and activation were studied using whole blood flow cytometry. Individuals in the MET group, but no in the NTX group, had higher plasma levels of inflammation and immune activation markers than controls. These markers include soluble CD14 (an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality during HIV infection), proinflammatory cytokines, and proinflammatory IgG glycans. This effect was independent of time on treatment. Our results indicate that methadone-based MOUD regimens may sustain immune activation and inflammation in ART-treated HIV-infected individuals. Our pilot study provides the foundation and rationale for future longitudinal functional studies of the impact of MOUD regimens on immune reconstitution and residual activation after ART-mediated suppression.","Comments":"2022-10-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Azzoni L ; Giron L B; Vadrevu S ; Zhao L ; Lalley-Chareczko L ; Hiserodt E ; Fair M ; Lynn K ; Trooskin S ; Mounzer K ; Abdel-Mohsen M ; Montaner L J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/JLB.4A1221-678RR","Keywords":"anti human immunodeficiency virus agent\r\nbenzodiazepine derivative\r\ncannabinoid\r\nCD14 antigen\r\nimmunoglobulin G\r\ninterleukin 18\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nneopterin\r\nserotonin uptake inhibitor\r\nvascular cell adhesion molecule 1\r\nadult\r\nantiretroviral therapy\r\narticle\r\ncapillary electrophoresis\r\nclinical article\r\ncohort analysis\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncross-sectional study\r\nenzyme linked immunosorbent assay\r\nfemale\r\nflow cytometry\r\nglycosylation\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infected patient\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nimmune reconstitution\r\nimmunoglobulin blood level\r\nimmunomodulation\r\ninflammation\r\nmale\r\nmiddle aged\r\nopiate addiction\r\npilot study\r\nprotein expression\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Azzoni L, Giron L B, Vadrevu S, Zhao L, Lalley-Chareczko L, Hiserodt E, Fair M, Lynn K, Trooskin S, Mounzer K, Abdel-Mohsen M, and Montaner L J (2022) Methadone use is associated with increased levels of sCD14, immune activation, and inflammation during suppressed HIV infection.

Little is known, however, about gender differences and opioid use disorders. OBJECTIVES: To compare demographic characteristics, substance use severity, and other associated areas of functioning (as measured by the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite)) among opioid-dependent men and women participating in a multisite effectiveness trial. METHODS: Participants were 892 adults screened for the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network investigation of the effectiveness of two buprenorphine tapering schedules. RESULTS: The majority of men and women tested positive for oxycodone (68% and 65%, respectively) and morphine (89% each). More women than men tested positive for amphetamines (4% vs. 1%, p < .01), methamphetamine (11% vs. 4%, p < .01), and phencyclidine (8% vs. 4%, p = .02). More men than women tested positive for methadone (11% vs. 6%, p = .05) and marijuana (22% vs. 15%, p = .03). Craving for opioids was significantly higher among women (p < .01). Men evidenced higher alcohol (p < .01) and legal (p = .04) ASI composite scores, whereas women had higher drug (p < .01), employment (p < .01), family (p < .01), medical (p < .01), and psychiatric (p < .01) ASI composite scores. Women endorsed significantly more current and past medical problems. CONCLUSIONS: Important gender differences in the clinical profiles of opioid-dependent individuals were observed with regard to substance use severity, craving, medical conditions, and impairment in associated areas of functioning. The findings enhance understanding of the characteristics of treatment-seeking men and women with opioid dependence, and may be useful in improving identification, prevention, and treatment efforts for this challenging and growing population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Back SE ; Payne RL ; Wahlquist AH ; Carter RE ; Stroud Z ; Haynes L ; Hillhouse M ; Brady KT ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00952990.2011.596982 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/epidemiology/*rehabilitation\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSex Factors\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology\r\nUnited States/epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Back SE, Payne RL, Wahlquist AH, Carter RE, Stroud Z, Haynes L, Hillhouse M, Brady KT, and Ling W (2011) Comparative profiles of men and women with opioid dependence: results from a national multisite effectiveness trial..

METHODS: This pilot study prospectively enrolled infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestational age admitted for treatment of NAS. After informed consent was obtained, infants were randomized to receive morphine (0.4 mg/kg per day) or clonidine (5 μg/kg per day) divided into 8 doses. A 25% dose escalation every 24 hours was possible per protocol (maximum of 1 mg/kg per day for morphine and 12 μg/kg per day for clonidine). After control of symptoms, the dose was tapered by 10% every other day. Clinical staff monitored infants by using Finnegan scoring. Masked research staff administered the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at 1 week and at 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of treatment and the Bayley Scales III, and Preschool Language Scale IV, at 1-year adjusted age. Analyses included descriptive statistics, repeated measures analysis of variance, and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: Infants treated with morphine (n = 15) versus clonidine (n = 16) did not differ in birth weight or age at treatment. Treatment duration was significantly longer for morphine (median 39 days) than for clonidine (median 28 days; P = .02). NNNS summary scores improved significantly with clonidine but not with morphine. On subsequent assessment, those receiving clonidine had lower height of arousal and excitability (P < .05). One-year motor, cognitive, and language scores did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine may be a favorable alternative to morphine as a single-drug therapy for NAS. A multicenter randomized trial is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bada HS ; Sithisarn T ; Gibson J ; Garlitz K ; Caldwell R ; Capilouto G ; Li Y ; Leggas M ; Breheny P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1542/peds.2014-2377 ","Keywords":"Analgesics/*therapeutic use\r\nArousal/drug effects\r\nClonidine/*therapeutic use\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*rehabilitation\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPsychomotor Agitation/rehabilitation\r\nclonidine\r\nmorphine\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nneurobehavioral manifestations\r\nneurobehavioral scale\r\nprenatal opiate exposure","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bada HS, Sithisarn T, Gibson J, Garlitz K, Caldwell R, Capilouto G, Li Y, Leggas M, and Breheny P (2015) Morphine versus clonidine for neonatal abstinence syndrome..

The therapeutic approaches for this syndrome vary in clinical practice, and in some centres, breastfeeding and rooming-in are interrupted. The aim of this work was to analyse the effects of breastfeeding and rooming-in in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome by conducting a scoping review of the related literature in PubMed and CINAHL. Eleven papers were included, which showed that breastfeeding and rooming-in reduced hospital stay and the need for and duration of pharmacological treatment. In addition, rooming-in decreased the likelihood of admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, although there was no improvement of the severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome signs. Breastfed infants had milder withdrawal signs and, although they were more likely to be readmitted than formula-fed infants were, there were no statistically significant differences. There was no evidence that rooming-in decreased hospital readmission after discharge. Our findings support the maintenance of cohabitation and breastfeeding whenever possible in the management of this neonatal abstinence syndrome, so as not to worsen the conditions of the neonate, while introducing measures to ensure mother-child safety.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baeza-Gozalo P ; Sola-Cía S ; López-Dicastillo O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.23938/ASSN.1048 ","Keywords":"Infant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nFemale\r\nPregnancy\r\nHumans\r\n*Breast Feeding\r\n*Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome/therapy\r\nHospitalization\r\nLength of Stay\r\nPatient Discharge","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baeza-Gozalo P, Sola-Cía S, and López-Dicastillo O (2023) [Breastfeeding and rooming-in in the management of neonatal abstinence syndrome.

Variability in assessment and treatment of NAS has been attributed to the lack of high-quality evidence to guide management of exposed neonates. This systematic review examines available evidence for NAS assessment tools, nonpharmacologic interventions, and pharmacologic management of opioid-exposed infants. There is limited data on the inter-observer reliability of NAS assessment tools due to lack of a standardized approach. In addition, most scales were developed prior to the prevalent use of prescribed prenatal concomitant medications, which can complicate NAS assessment. Nonpharmacologic interventions, particularly breastfeeding, may decrease NAS severity. Opioid medications such as morphine or methadone are recommended as first-line therapy, with phenobarbital or clonidine as second-line adjunctive therapy. Further research is needed to determine best practices for assessment, nonpharmacologic intervention, and pharmacologic management of infants with NAS in order to improve outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bagley SM ; Wachman EM ; Holland E ; Brogly SB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1940-0640-9-19 ","Keywords":"Breast Feeding\r\nBuprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nClonidine/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*adverse effects\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*diagnosis/*therapy\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/diagnosis/therapy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/diagnosis/therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bagley SM, Wachman EM, Holland E, and Brogly SB (2014) Review of the assessment and management of neonatal abstinence syndrome..

In Canada, OUD is at the forefront of the opioid epidemic, which has claimed more than 8000 lives between January 2016 and March 2018. As individuals with OUD are more likely to receive health services from the emergency department and acute hospitalizations, it makes logical sense for there to be a move toward improving the quality of hospital-based services. Hospitalization represents a golden opportunity to connect patients who have OUD with evidence-based treatments.Objectives:To evaluate the effectiveness and offering of hospital-based interventions for individuals with OUD by way of a scoping review.Data sources:Five online databases were searched in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines.Study selection:Randomized and nonrandomized intervention studies were considered eligible for inclusion in this scoping review.Results:Twenty two of 354 retrieved papers met inclusion criteria.

However, there is significant uncertainty about the risks of cause-specific mortality in and out of treatment. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the association between methadone and buprenorphine with cause-specific mortality among opioid-dependent persons. METHODS: We searched six online databases to identify relevant cohort studies, calculating all-cause and overdose-specific mortality rates during periods in and out of treatment. We pooled mortality estimates using multivariate random effects meta-analysis of the crude mortality rate per 1000 person-years of follow-up as well as relative risks comparing mortality in vs. out of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 32 cohort studies (representing 150 235 participants, 805 423.6 person-years, and 9112 deaths) met eligibility criteria. Crude mortality rates were substantially higher among methadone cohorts than buprenorphine cohorts. Relative risk reduction was substantially higher with methadone relative to buprenorphine when time in-treatment was compared to time out-of-treatment. Furthermore, the greatest mortality reduction was conferred during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Mortality estimates were substantially heterogeneous and varied significantly by country, region, and by the nature of the treatment provider. CONCLUSION: Precautions are necessary for the safer implementation of opioid agonist therapy, including baseline assessments of opioid tolerance, ongoing monitoring during the induction period, education of patients about the risk of overdose, and coordination within healthcare services.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bahji A ; Cheng B ; Gray S ; Stuart H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/acps.13088 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*agonists/therapeutic \r\n      use\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nCohort Studies\r\nDatabases, Factual\r\nDrug Overdose/*mortality\r\nDrug Tolerance\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nMonitoring, Physiologic/methods\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*mortality/psychology/*therapy\r\nPatient Education as Topic\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRisk\r\nanalgesics\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ndrug overdose\r\nhumans\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid\r\nopioid-related disorders\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bahji A, Cheng B, Gray S, and Stuart H (2019) Reduction in mortality risk with opioid agonist therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

Despite this, harm reduction interventions have not been widely adopted in inpatient settings for individuals with IDU-IE.Objectives:The aim of this systematic review was to determine the types, effectiveness, and availability of targeted harm reduction interventions for individuals with IDU-IE. In this review, harm reduction was defined as any practice aimed at reducing negative consequences associated with substance use.Methods:In accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines, 5 electronic databases were systematically searched to identify studies targeting harm reduction interventions for individuals with IDU-IE. Study quality was appraised using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Key findings of studies were summarized descriptively as a quantitative meta-analysis could not be undertaken.Results:Four studies (involving 221 participants) met eligibility criteria. The mean age was 39.3±16.7 years, 69.8% were males and 80.7% had an opioid use disorder. Harm reduction interventions included inpatient addictions consultations, needle hygiene interventions, and outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. Such interventions were associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for individuals with IDU-IE: 19% of patients receiving inpatient addictions consultation subsequently accepted residential treatment, 38% engaged in follow-up, and monthly illicit opioid use was lowered from 16.5 days to 1.5 days. Six-month mortality was 7.1%. Of the patients who received outpatient parenteral antibiotics, 93% did not experience any recurrent infections during follow-up and there were no patient deaths.

The opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX) is effective for the prevention of relapse to OUD and may be more acceptable in criminal justice settings. The objectives of this review were to: (1) provide an overall summary effect across studies for the efficacy and acceptability of oral and injectable NTX for the treatment of OUD among criminal justice-involved individuals and (2) examine systematic variations in study results to explain heterogeneity among study-specific effects. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 1045 patients across 11 studies (10 randomized controlled trials, one quasi-experimental study). All available outcomes were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for oral and injectable naltrexone; meta-regression analyses were conducted for socio-demographic and study-level characteristics. RESULTS: NTX improved retention in treatment [risk ratio (RR) = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05, 1.63], reduced rates of re-incarceration (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.54-0.92), reduced opioid relapse (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.53-0.76) and improved opioid abstinence (RR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.16-1.65). While NTX was associated with a greater burden of adverse events overall (RR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.13-1.95), the findings were inconclusive as to whether or not a difference was present for the number of serious adverse events or overdoses. CONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone appears to be efficacious and acceptable for the treatment of opioid use disorder among criminal justice-involved individuals; however, the risk for adverse events must be weighed against the potential benefits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bahji A ; Carlone D ; Altomare J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.14946 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Criminals\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Overdose/prevention & control\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nRecurrence\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAnalgesics, opioid\r\ncriminal justice-involved individuals\r\ndrug overdose\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopioid-related disorders\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bahji A, Carlone D, and Altomare J (2020) Acceptability and efficacy of naltrexone for criminal justice-involved individuals with opioid use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis..

They were divided into two groups randomly assigned to receive either clonidine (0.15–0.3 mg/day) or clonidine with amantadine (100–200 mg/day). We assessed withdrawal symptoms with the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) on the first day of admission and 3, 7, 14, and 21 days afterward. Results: Forty-three patients completed the trial in each group. The impact of adding-on amantadine on the mean SOWS compared to control was significant (p < .001) at any time of the study period. However, there were no significant differences in mean SOWS within groups during follow-up (p > .05). Also, there were no significant differences in mean SOWS between the two groups during follow-up time (day 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 21st) (p > .05).

METHODS: We explored associations between methadone and BUP-NX doses and treatment outcomes using data from OPTIMA, a 24-week, pragmatic, open-label, multicenter, pan-Canadian, randomized controlled, two-arm parallel trial with participants (N = 272) with OUD who primarily use opioids other than heroin. Participants were randomized to receive flexible take-home BUP-NX (n = 138) or standard supervised methadone treatment (n = 134). We examined associations between highest BUP-NX and methadone doses, and (1) percentage of opioid-positive urine drug screens (UDS); (2) retention in the assigned treatment; and (3) adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: The mean (SD) highest BUP-NX and methadone dose were 17.31 mg/day (8.59) and 67.70 mg/day (34.70). BUP-NX and methadone doses were not associated with opioid-positive UDS percentages or AEs. Methadone dose was associated with higher retention in treatment (odds ratio [OR]: 1.025; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.010; 1.041), while BUP-NX dose was not (OR: 1.055; 95% CI: 0.990; 1.124). Higher methadone doses (70-110 mg/day) offered higher odds of treatment retention. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Methadone dose was associated with higher retention, which may be related to its full µ-opioid receptor agonism. Future research should notably ascertain the effect of pace of titration on a wide range of outcomes. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our results extend previous findings of high doses of methadone increasing retention to be applied in our population using opioids other than heroin, including highly potent opioids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bakouni H ; McAnulty C ; Tatar O ; Socias ME ; Le Foll B ; Lim R ; Ahamad K ; Jutras-Aswad D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/ajad.13439 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nMethadone/adverse effects\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\nHeroin\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/methods\r\nCanada\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Buprenorphine/adverse effects\r\nPrescriptions\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/adverse effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bakouni H, McAnulty C, Tatar O, Socias ME, Le Foll B, Lim R, Ahamad K, and Jutras-Aswad D (2023) Associations of methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone doses with unregulated opioid use, treatment retention, and adverse events in prescription-type opioid use disorders: Exploratory analyses of the OPTIMA study..

This study investigated whether maternal methadone/buprenorphine dose and nicotine use in pregnancy affects the occurrence and duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the infant. Methods: Forty-one pregnant women from OMT programmes in Norway who gave birth between January 2005 and January 2007 were enrolled in a national prospective study. Thirty-eight women (81% of the population) were interviewed in the last trimester of pregnancy and 3 months after delivery. Data from the European Addiction Severity Index and a questionnaire measuring enrolled birth information were compared with medical records and urine analyses. Results: Treatment requiring NAS occurred in 58% of the methadone-exposed and in 67% of the buprenorphine-exposed infants. There was no significant relationship between a maternal dose of methadone or buprenorphine in pregnancy and NAS treatment duration for the infant. The mean number of cigarettes consumed correlated significantly with NAS treatment duration for the methadone group. Birth weight for the methadone group was approximately 200 g above international findings despite high doses during pregnancy. Conclusions: Maternal methadone/ buprenorphine dose predicted neither the occurrence nor the need for NAS treatment for the infant. © 2009 S.

Methods: We searched four databases through May 21st, 2022: PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo and the Web of Science according to a specified search strings. Study inclusion criteria include: (1) cohort and case-control peer-reviewed studies published in English; (2) studies comparing neurodevelopmental outcomes among children with prenatal opioid-exposure (prescribed or used non-medically) vs. an unexposed group. Studies investigating fetal alcohol syndrome or a different primary prenatal exposure other than opioids were excluded. Two main performed data extraction using “Covidence” systematic review platform. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale was used for quality assessment of the studies. Studies were synthesized based on the type of neurodevelopmental outcome and the instrument used to assess neurodevelopment. Results: Data were extracted from 79 studies. We found significant heterogeneity between studies due to their use of different instruments to explore cognitive skills, motor, and behavioral outcomes among children of different ages. The other sources of heterogeneity included: procedures to assess prenatal exposure to opioids; period of pregnancy in which exposure was assessed; type of opioids assessed (non-medical, medication used for opioid use dis-order, prescribed by health professional), types of co-exposure; source of selection of prenatally exposed study participants and comparison groups; and methods to address lack of comparability between exposed and unexposed groups. Cognitive and motor skills as well as behavior were generally negatively affected by prenatal opioid exposure, but the significant heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. Conclusion: We explored sources of heterogeneity in the studies assessing the association between prenatal exposure to opioids and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Sources of heterogeneity included different approaches to participant recruitment as well as exposure and outcome ascertainment methods.

A major barrier to people accessing Medication-assisted treatment of the opioid use disorder (MOUD) is the lack of providers who can prescribe and monitor MOUD. According to the World Drug Report, more young people are using drugs compared with previous generations and people in need of treatment cannot get it, women most of all. Nurse prescribers have the potential to enhance both access and treatment outcomes. Nurse prescribing practices do, however, vary greatly internationally. The aim of this scoping review is to explore nurse prescribing practices for MOUD globally with a view to informing equitable access and policies for people seeking MOUD. METHODS: This scoping review was informed by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Electronic searches from 2010 to date were conducted on the following databases: PsycInfo, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. Only studies that met the eligibility criteria and described nurse prescribing policies and/or behaviours for MOUD were included. RESULTS: A total of 22 articles were included in the review which found several barriers and enablers to nurse prescribing of MOUD. Barriers included legislation constraints, lack of professional education and training and the presence of stigmatizing attitudes. Enablers included the presence of existing supportive services, prosocial messaging, and nurse prescriber autonomy. CONCLUSION: The safety and efficacy of nurse prescribing of MOUD is well established, and its expansion can provide a range of advantages to people who are dependent on opiates. This includes increasing access to treatment. Nurse prescribing of MOUD can increase the numbers of people in treatment from 'hard to reach' cohorts such as rural settings, or those with less financial means. It holds significant potential to reduce a wide range of harms and costs associated with high-risk opiate use. To reduce drug-related death and the global burden of harm to individuals, families, and communities, there is an urgent need to address the two key priorities of nurse prescriber legislation and education. Both of which are possible given political and educational commitment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Banka-Cullen SP ; Comiskey C ; Kelly P ; Zeni MB ; Gutierrez A ; Menon U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12954-023-00812-y ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nEducational Status\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPolicy\r\nMOUD\r\nMedication-assisted treatment\r\nNurse prescriber\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nScoping review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Banka-Cullen SP, Comiskey C, Kelly P, Zeni MB, Gutierrez A, and Menon U (2023) Nurse prescribing practices across the globe for medication-assisted treatment of the opioid use disorder (MOUD): a scoping review..

Although medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is the standard of treatment, utilization among PPWP has remained low because of MOUD stigma and misconceptions. The current report examined general and pregnancy-related MOUD attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy among PPWP seeking treatment. Methods Participants (n = 33) receiving MOUD at a Midwestern clinic reported beliefs about MOUD in general using the Attitudes toward Methadone Questionnaire (modified to include all MOUD) and during pregnancy/postpartum using an investigator-generated scale based on previous research. Participants responded using a 5-point scale from \"strongly agree\"to \"strongly disagree\"with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes. Analyses examined the bivariate association of attitudes with MOUD subjective norms and self-efficacy, also measured via investigator-generated scales. Results Respondents reported positive attitudes toward MOUD use during pregnancy, with most agreeing it was safe. However, up-to-half of participants reported uncertainty regarding the appropriate dosage of MOUD and its impact on the fetus and/or neonate. Both general and pregnancy/postpartum-related MOUD attitudes were positively associated with subjective norms toward MOUD. Conclusions Pregnant and postpartum women and people reported high uncertainty about MOUD use despite currently using it, emphasizing the need for strategies that assess and mitigate MOUD-related stigma. Findings suggest that familial support and stigma impact attitudes toward MOUD and highlight the importance of accurate psychoeducation and social supports for patients and their families to improve the acceptance and utilization of MOUD among PPWP.","Comments":"2023-07-13","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Banks D E; Fentem A ; Li X ; Paschke M ; Filiatreau L ; Woolfolk C ; Cavazos-Rehg P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000001113","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndemographics\r\nfamily support\r\nfemale\r\nhealth belief\r\nhelp seeking behavior\r\nhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient attitude\r\npregnancy\r\npsychopharmacotherapy\r\npuerperium\r\nself concept\r\nsocial norm\r\nstatistics\r\nstigma\r\nuncertainty","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Banks D E, Fentem A, Li X, Paschke M, Filiatreau L, Woolfolk C, and Cavazos-Rehg P (2023) Attitudes Toward Medication for Opioid Use Disorder Among Pregnant and Postpartum Women and People Seeking Treatment.

Methods: A systematic literature search identified 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating methadone dose and retention. Retention was defined as the percentage of patients remaining in treatment at a specified time point. After initial univariate analyses of retention by Pearson chi-squares, we used multilevel logistic regression to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the effects of methadone dose (above or below 60 mg/day), flexible vs. fixed dosing strategy, and duration of follow-up. Results: The total number of opioid-dependent participants in the 18 studies was 2831, with 1797 in MMT and 1034 receiving alternative mediations or placebo. Each variable significantly predicted retention with the other variables controlled for. Retention was greater with methadone doses ≥ 60 than with doses < 60 (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.43-2.11). Similarly, retention was greater with flexible-dose strategies than with fixed-dose strategies (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.41-2.11). Conclusions: Higher doses of methadone and individualization of doses are each independently associated with better retention in MMT.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although efficacy data is pending, there is emerging biological and public health plausibility data suggesting the utility of PrEP as an effective component of combination HIV prevention for IDU. Drawing from studies characterizing adherence to antiretroviral therapy for IDU, there are a range of scientific and operational considerations for the potential use of PrEP for IDU. We review here the available literature on the potential use of PrEP for IDU, barriers to uptake and adherence, and potential implementation science questions, which could address, and potently increase, the effectiveness of this intervention. SUMMARY: IDU remain the most underserved population in the HIV response worldwide, and have a marked gap in prevention services, making PrEP a potentially promising addition to the prevention toolkit for people who use drugs and, for those already living with HIV infection, for their spouses and other sexual partners.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baral SD ; Strömdahl S ; Beyrer C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/COH.0b013e328358e49e ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAnti-HIV Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nChemoprevention/*methods\r\nClinical Trials as Topic\r\nFemale\r\nHIV Infections/*prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*complications","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baral SD, Strömdahl S, and Beyrer C (2012) The potential uses of preexposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention among people who inject drugs..

Economic evaluations using simulation modeling can guide the allocation of resources and help tackle the opioid crisis. This study reviews methods employed by economic evaluations using computer simulations to investigate the health and economic effects of interventions meant to address opioid misuse. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping review of studies that used simulation modeling to support the economic evaluation of interventions targeting prevention, treatment, or management of opioid misuse or its direct consequences (ie, overdose). We searched 6 databases and extracted information on study population, interventions, costs, outcomes, and economic analysis and modeling approaches. Results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies considered only one segment of the continuum of care. Of the studies, 13 evaluated medications for opioid use disorder, and 5 evaluated naloxone distribution programs to reduce overdose deaths. Most studies estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years and used health system and/or societal perspectives. Models were decision trees (n = 4), Markov (n = 10) or semi-Markov models (n = 3), and microsimulations (n = 1). All of the studies assessed parameter uncertainty though deterministic and/or probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 4 conducted formal calibration, only 2 assessed structural uncertainty, and only 1 conducted expected value of information analyses. Only 10 studies conducted validation. Conclusions: Future economic evaluations should consider synergies between interventions and examine combinations of interventions to inform optimal policy response. They should also more consistently conduct model validation and assess the value of further research.","Comments":"2020-08-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barbosa C ; Dowd W N; Zarkin G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jval.2020.03.015","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nhydromorphone\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nbrain depth stimulation\r\ncomputer simulation\r\ncost benefit analysis\r\ndecision tree\r\ndrug intoxication\r\neconomic evaluation\r\nhealth status\r\nhuman\r\nMarkov chain\r\nmedicaid\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\npriority journal\r\npsychosocial care\r\nquality adjusted life year\r\nreimbursement\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barbosa C, Dowd W N, and Zarkin G (2020) Economic Evaluation of Interventions to Address Opioid Misuse: A Systematic Review of Methods Used in Simulation Modeling Studies.

This presents a significant barrier to treatment in cases of acute pain, severe dependence, and critical care. Instead, small and steadily escalating doses of buprenorphine can be given over several days, known as microinduction. This can occur in conjunction with full opioid agonist treatment. In critically ill, opioiddependent patients, this approach can allow tapering of other opioids and sedatives, facilitating extubation. Additionally, the transition can occur alongside other clinical priorities rather than being delayed until near discharge. Microinduction has been described inmultiple settings before, but not during pregnancy. Case Report: A 33-year-old pregnant patient at 31 1/7 weeks gestation with opioid, sedative-hypnotic, and other substance use disorders and history of endocarditis, neurosyphilis, and hepatitis C presented after being found down with altered mental status. She was intubated in the emergency department for respiratory failure and admitted to the medical intensive care unit on fentanyl and midazolam infusions. Several attempts to wean opioids were unsuccessful, preventing traditional buprenorphine induction. She required escalating doses of opioids and sedatives for agitation and severe dependence, peaking at midazolam 6 mg/h, fentanyl 175mg/h, methadone 30 mg/d, and phenobarbital 390 mg/d. Norepinephrine was given for hypotension from this regimen. Subsequently, she was started on a buprenorphine microinduction of 150mg → 300mg → μmg → 2mg ! 4 mg, each given buccally every 6 hours for 4 doses. Microgram doses were given as isolated buprenorphine (Belbuca), milligram doses were given as buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone). Induction proceeded smoothly. The day after completing microinduction, both methadone and fentanyl were stopped. She was transitioned onto dexmedetomidine and midazolam was also stopped. She was extubated the next day. Buprenorphine 8mg buccally every 8 hours was continued for maintenance therapy. Her altered mental status resolved shortly after. Coordination of care was arranged with an outpatient substance use disorder treatment program but she left against medical advice. She returned at 38 0/7 weeks and delivered a viable male infant via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. His neonatal course was complicated by neonatal abstinence syndrome, mild laryngomalacia, and poor feeding requiring gastrostomy. Discussion: This case demonstrates successful buprenorphine microinduction in a critically ill pregnant patient with severe opioid dependence. Microinduction directly contributed to her recovery, allowing better control of her opioid dependence and withdrawal and reduction of her high opioid and sedative needs. This allowed for earlier extubation and reduced time in intensive care. There is no evidence that microinduction is harmful in pregnancy, and in our case a standard microinduction approach was successful. This is the first such case reported during pregnancy. Conclusions: Buprenorphine microinduction should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate standard buprenorphine induction. Pregnancy is not a barrier to microinduction. Theoretic downstream risks from neonatal abstinence syndrome have not been demonstrated in recent studies, and opioid replacement therapy should not be withheld in pregnancy.","Comments":"2021-11-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barbour K ; McQuade M ; Seligman N S; Wiegand T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000902","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ndexmedetomidine\r\nfentanyl\r\nmethadone\r\nmidazolam\r\nnoradrenalin\r\nopiate\r\nphenobarbital\r\nsedative agent\r\nadult\r\nadverse drug reaction\r\nagitation\r\nboy\r\nbuccal drug administration\r\ncase report\r\nclinical article\r\ncomplication\r\nconference abstract\r\ncritically ill patient\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nemergency ward\r\nendocarditis\r\nextubation\r\nfeeding\r\nfemale\r\ngastrostomy\r\nhepatitis C\r\nhuman\r\nhypotension\r\ninfant\r\nlaryngomalacia\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmale\r\nmedical intensive care unit\r\nmental health\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nneurosyphilis\r\nnewborn\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\noutpatient\r\npregnancy\r\nrespiratory failure\r\nside effect\r\ntheoretical study\r\nvaginal delivery\r\nweaning","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barbour K, McQuade M, Seligman N S, and Wiegand T (2021) Buprenorphine micro-induction in pregnancy.

Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Participants described their study experience as mostly positive, but also concurrently held or developed study medication apprehensions and misperceptions. First, some participants described apprehension, lack of control, and uneasiness regarding their assigned treatment. Second, some participants perceived their treatment as \"placebos\" and/or were convinced that their treatment was ineffective, shaping perceptions of impact on their substance use. Third, some participants perceived study treatments as cure-alls for substance use disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Participant perceptions of trial interventions may frame their experience and participation in clinical studies. These findings demonstrate the need for researchers and clinicians to consider how apprehension and a lack of medication receptivity may impact enrollment and participant autonomy.

Research has also demonstrated challenges to accessing SUD care in the US criminal justice system. We conducted a systematic review of access to SUD care in the US criminal justice system. METHODS: We searched for comprehensive qualitative studies in multiple databases through April 2021, and two researchers reviewed 6858 studies using pre-selected inclusion criteria. Once eligibility was determined, themes were extracted from the data. This review provides a thematic overview of the US qualitative studies to inform future research-based interventions. This review was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). RESULTS: There were 6858 unique abstract results identified for review, and seven qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Two themes were identified from these results: (1) managing withdrawal from medication-assisted treatment, and (2) facilitators and barriers to treatment programs in the criminal justice system. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative research evaluating access to SUD care in the US criminal justice system varied, with some interventions reported not rooted in evidence-based medicine. An opportunity may exist to develop best practices to ensure evidence-based treatment for SUDs is delivered to patients who need it in the US criminal justice system.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barenie RE ; Cernasev A ; Jasmin H ; Knight P ; Chisholm-Burns M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph191912647 ","Keywords":"*Criminal Law/methods\r\nHumans\r\nQualitative Research\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology/therapy\r\nUnited States\r\ncriminal justice system\r\nsubstance use disorder\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barenie RE, Cernasev A, Jasmin H, Knight P, and Chisholm-Burns M (2022) A Qualitative Systematic Review of Access to Substance Use Disorder Care in the United States Criminal Justice System..

ALO-02, an abuse-deterrent opioid formulation, is designed to release sequestered naltrexone upon manipulation by crushing, thereby antagonizing the pharmacologic effects of oxycodone. This exploratory post-hoc analysis examined the effects of IV administration of simulated crushed ALO-02 on end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), a surrogate marker of respiratory depression. Methods: Data were obtained from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study in nondependent recreational opioid users that evaluated the abuse potential of IV administered oxycodone 20 mg + naltrexone 2.4 mg (simulating crushed ALO-02) versus oxycodone 20 mg or placebo. EtCO2 was measured as a secondary endpoint using noninvasive capnography at baseline and postdose intervals, up to 24 h. Results: Baseline EtCO2 (mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)) values (n = 33) were similar across treatments: 33.5 ± 0.9, 33.5 ± 0.8, and 34.0 ± 0.7 mmHg for oxycodone 20 mg naltrexone 2.4 mg, oxycodone 20 mg, and placebo, respectively. After dosing, mean ± SEM o f the maximum effect (Emax) on EtCO2 was 37.5 ± 0.6, 40.5 ± 0.8, and 36.9 ± 0.6 mmHg for oxycodone 20 mg + naltrexone 2.4 mg, oxycodone 20 mg, and placebo, respectively. Emax values were significantly lower for oxycodone 20 mg + naltrexone 2.4 mg versus oxycodone 20 mg (p = 0.0005), and not different from placebo (p > 0.05). Conclusions: This abuse-potential study suggests that naltrexone released from ALO-02 tampering by crushing attenuates oxycodone-induced increase of EtCO2 in nondependent recreational opioid users.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bass A ; Webster L R; Matschke K T; Malhotra B K; Wolfram G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/2042098618821274","Keywords":"article\r\ncapnometry\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndepression\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug combination\r\ndrug overdose\r\ndrug therapy\r\nhuman\r\nintravenous drug administration\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprescription\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrespiration depression\r\nnaltrexone\r\nnaltrexone plus oxycodone\r\nopiate\r\noxycodone\r\nplacebo","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bass A, Webster L R, Matschke K T, Malhotra B K, and Wolfram G (2019) Effects of intravenous oxycodone alone or in combination with naltrexone on measures of respiratory depression: a randomized placebo-controlled study.

Dosing of buprenorphine in pregnant women is based on the regimen recommended for nonpregnant females and males. Limited data are available defining the pharmacokinetic properties of sublingual buprenorphine administered during pregnancy. Objective This study evaluated the impact of physiological changes associated with pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics of sublingual buprenorphine during and after pregnancy. Study Design Pregnant women (n = 13), between 180/7 and 376/7 weeks’ singleton gestation, receiving sublingual buprenorphine twice daily for opioid use disorders were studied. Pharmacokinetic-2 studies were performed between 18 and 25 weeks (n = 7), pharmacokinetic-3 studies were performed between 31 and 37 weeks (n = 11), and pharmacokinetic-P was performed 4-18 weeks postpartum (n = 10). On the day of the study, blood was withdrawn prior to the daily morning dose of buprenorphine and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after the dose. Buprenorphine plasma concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric detection. All pharmacokinetic parameters were observed or estimated using Microsoft Excel. Statistical analyses were performed to identify significant changes in study participants’ buprenorphine pharmacokinetic parameter estimates over the duration of the study. Univariate linear and generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate changes in these measures over time, some of which were log transformed for normality. Results Dose-normalized (plasma concentration per dose) buprenorphine plasma concentrations were significantly lower during pregnancy (pharmacokinetic-2 plus pharmacokinetic-3) than during the postpartum period (pharmacokinetic-P). Specific pharmacokinetic parameters (and level of significance) were as follows: the area under the buprenorphine plasma concentration-time curves (P <.003), maximum buprenorphine concentrations (P <.018), buprenorphine concentrations at 0 hour (P <.002), and buprenorphine concentrations at 12 hours (P <.001). None of these parameters differed significantly during pregnancy (ie, pharmacokinetic-2 vs pharmacokinetic-3). The time to maximum buprenorphine concentrations did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion The dose-normalized plasma concentrations during a dosing interval and the overall exposure of buprenorphine (area under the buprenorphine plasma concentration-time curves) are lower throughout pregnancy compared with the postpartum period. This indicates an increase in apparent clearance of buprenorphine during pregnancy. These data suggest that pregnant women may need a higher dose of sublingual buprenorphine compared with postpartum individuals. The dose of buprenorphine should be assessed after delivery to maintain similar buprenorphine exposure during the postpartum period.","Comments":"2017-03-07","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bastian J R; Chen H ; Zhang H ; Rothenberger S ; Tarter R ; English D ; Venkataramanan R ; Caritis S N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajog.2016.09.095","Keywords":"albumin\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine glucuronide\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ndrug metabolite\r\nnorbuprenorphine\r\nnorbuprenorphine glucuronide\r\nunclassified drug\r\nadult\r\narea under the curve\r\nclinical article\r\nconference paper\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug blood level\r\ndrug half life\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmaximum plasma concentration\r\nmorning dosage\r\nopiate addiction\r\npH\r\npharmacokinetics\r\nplasma concentration-time curve\r\npregnancy\r\npregnant woman\r\npriority journal\r\npuerperium\r\ntime to maximum plasma concentration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bastian J R, Chen H, Zhang H, Rothenberger S, Tarter R, English D, Venkataramanan R, and Caritis S N (2017) Dose-adjusted plasma concentrations of sublingual buprenorphine are lower during than after pregnancy.

This trial also evaluated whether improvements in depressive symptoms were mediated by opioid use. METHODS: Analyzed data came from the OPTIMA study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03033732), a pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing flexible take-home dosing of BUP/NX and methadone standard model of care for reducing opioid use in people with POUD. A total of 272 participants were recruited in four Canadian provinces. Participants were randomised 1:1 to BUP/NX or methadone. After treatment induction, past two-week opioid use was measured using the Timeline Followback every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline, weeks 12 and 24. RESULTS: Both BUP/NX and methadone significantly reduced depressive symptoms at week 12 (aβ ± SE = -3.167 ± 1.233; P < 0.001) and week 24 (aβ ± SE = -7.280 ± 1.285; P < 0.001), with no interaction between type of treatment and time (P = 0.284). Improvements in depressive symptoms were only partially mediated by a reduction in opioid use (proportion mediated = 36.8%; 95% confidence interval = -1.158 to -0.070; P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: BUP/NX and methadone showed similar effectiveness in decreasing comorbid depressive symptoms in people with POUD. This effect was partially explained by a reduction in opioid use. As both treatments seem equally effective, clinicians are encouraged to tailor the selection of OAT to patients' needs and characteristics.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bastien G ; McAnulty C ; Ledjiar O ; Socias ME ; Le Foll B ; Lim R ; Hassan AN ; Brissette S ; Marsan S ; Talbot A ; Jutras-Aswad D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/07067437221145013 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nDepression/drug therapy\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nCanada/epidemiology\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPrescriptions\r\ncomorbidity\r\ndepressive disorders\r\ndual diagnosis\r\nmajor depressive disorder\r\nrandomised controlled trial\r\nsubstance use disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bastien G, McAnulty C, Ledjiar O, Socias ME, Le Foll B, Lim R, Hassan AN, Brissette S, Marsan S, Talbot A, and Jutras-Aswad D (2023) Effects of Buprenorphine/Naloxone and Methadone on Depressive Symptoms in People with Prescription Opioid Use Disorder: A Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial..

In spite of the abundant research on substance dependence, there are few effective treatments for this disease. Given the crucial role of the endogenous opioid system in the development and maintenance of substance abuse disorders, this review focuses on the opioidergic system and examines the role of opioidergic genes in the treatment outcome of pharmacotherapies of alcohol, opioid, and cocaine addiction. Methods Scopus (all databases) and Pubmed were systematically searched with no language or year restrictions, up to July 2014, for studies that focused on the relationship between polymorphisms of opioidergic genes and the treatment outcome of pharmacotherapies of alcohol, opioid, and cocaine addictions. Selected search terms were opioid, gene, polymorphism, drug therapy, substance abuse, and response. Results and Conclusions The genetic variability of μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors genes OPRM1, OPRD1, and OPRK1 modulates the efficacy of opioid antagonist treatments such as naltrexone and methadone, as well as the cocaine vaccine. Despite the number of promising reports, data from additional cohorts are needed to substantiate these findings.

Current evidence suggests that genetic variability of the serotonergic biosynthesis enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) genes mediates the efficacy of several addiction treatments, such as ondansetron and disulfiram, and the antidepressants bupropion, nortriptyline and sertraline.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bauer IE ; Graham DP ; Soares JC ; Nielsen DA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2217/pgs.15.72 ","Keywords":"Genetic Variation\r\nHumans\r\nSerotonin/*genetics\r\nSerotonin Agents/therapeutic use\r\nSerotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTryptophan Hydroxylase/genetics\r\naddiction\r\nbupropion\r\ndisulfiram\r\ngene\r\nondansetron\r\nserotonergic\r\nsertraline\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bauer IE, Graham DP, Soares JC, and Nielsen DA (2015) Serotonergic gene variation in substance use pharmacotherapy: a systematic review..

Buprenorphine is an effective MOUD that may suppress craving; however, treatment discontinuation and resumed opioid use is common during the early phases of treatment. More information on the craving response through the high-risk period of initiating buprenorphine may provide meaningful information on how to better target craving, which in turn may enhance outcomes. This systematic review investigated buprenorphine doses and formulations on craving during the induction and maintenance phases of treatment, and for context also compared the craving response to other MOUD (i.e., methadone, extended-release naltrexone [XR-NTX]). Methods: PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases were searched for randomized trials of buprenorphine versus placebo, various buprenorphine formulations/doses, or other MOUD that included a measure of opioid craving. Results: A total of 10 studies were selected for inclusion. Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NAL) were each associated with lower craving than placebo over time. Craving was greater among those prescribed lower versus higher buprenorphine doses. In comparison to other MOUD, buprenorphine or BUP/NAL was linked to greater craving than methadone in 3 of the 6 studies. BUP/NAL was associated with greater reported craving than XR-NTX. Discussion: Craving is reduced over time with buprenorphine and BUP/NAL, although other MOUD may provide greater reductions in craving. Although there is currently considerable variability in the measurement of craving, it may be a valuable concept to address with individuals receiving MOUD, especially early in treatment.","Comments":"2023-01-10","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baxley C ; Borsari B ; Reavis J V; Manuel J K; Herbst E ; Becker W ; Pennington D ; Batki S L; Seal K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2022.107589","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug formulation\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsustained drug release\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baxley C, Borsari B, Reavis J V, Manuel J K, Herbst E, Becker W, Pennington D, Batki S L, and Seal K (2023) Effects of buprenorphine on opioid craving in comparison to other medications for opioid use disorder: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.

This trial involved 2 interventions: within-prison initiation of methadone maintenance therapy and an evidence-based behavioral intervention adapted to the Malaysian context (the Holistic Health Recovery Program for Malaysia, HHRP-M). Individuals were recruited and received the interventions while incarcerated and were followed for 12months after release to assess post-release HIV transmission risk behaviors and a range of other health-related outcomes. Project Harapan was designed as a fully randomized 2×2 factorial trial where individuals would be allocated in equal proportions to methadone maintenance therapy and HHRP-M, methadone maintenance therapy alone, HHRP-M alone, or control. Partway through study implementation, allocation to methadone maintenance therapy was changed from randomization to participant choice; randomization to HHRP-M continued throughout. We describe the justification for this study; the development and implementation of these interventions; changes to the protocol; and screening, enrollment, treatment receipt, and retention of study participants.

Maintenance with opioid agonist therapy (OAT) like methadone or buprenorphine reduces mortality in people with OUD and may confer benefits to people with OUD and HIV leaving prison. Survival benefits of OAT, however, have not been evaluated prospectively in people with OUD and HIV leaving prison. METHODS: This study prospectively evaluated mortality after prison release and whether methadone initiated before release increased survival after release in a sample of men with HIV and OUD (n = 291). We linked national death records to data from a controlled trial of prerelease methadone initiation conducted from 2010 to 2014 with men with HIV and OUD imprisoned in Malaysia. Vital statistics were collected through 2015. Allocation to prerelease methadone was by randomization (n = 64) and participant choice (n = 246). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate treatment effects of prerelease methadone on postrelease survival. RESULTS: Overall, 62 deaths occurred over 872.5 person-years (PY) of postrelease follow-up, a crude mortality rate of 71.1 deaths per 1000 PY (95% confidence interval [CI] 54.5-89.4). Most deaths were of infectious etiology, mostly related to HIV. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the impact of prerelease methadone on postrelease mortality was consistent with a null effect in unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR] 1.3, 95% CI 0.6-3.1) and covariate-adjusted (HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.5-2.8) models. Predictors of mortality were educational level (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.8), pre-incarceration alcohol use (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.9), and lower CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count (HR 0.8 per 100-cell/mL increase, 95% CI 0.7-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Postrelease mortality in this sample of men with HIV and OUD was extraordinarily high, and most deaths were likely of infectious etiology. No effect of prerelease methadone on postrelease mortality was observed, which may be due to study limitations or an epidemiological context in which inadequately treated HIV, and not inadequately treated OUD, is the main cause of death after prison release.

The overall impact of these policies is still uncertain. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the existing evidence of provider-level and patient-level outcomes preimplementation and postimplementation of policies and legislation constructed to impact provider prescribing practices around opioid analgesics. DESIGN: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted to identify studies evaluating the impact of opioid prescribing policies on provider-level and patient-level outcomes. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the review. A meta-analysis was not possible due to between-study heterogeneity. Six of the studies assessed state-level policies, and five were at the level of the healthcare system or hospital. Studies showed temporal associations between policy implementation and reductions in opioid prescribing, as well as opioid-related overdoses. Results were mixed regarding the impact of policies on misuse. The majority of the studies were judged to be of low quality based on the GRADE criteria. CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate quality evidence suggesting that the presence of opioid prescribing policy will reduce the amount and strength of opioid prescribed. The presence of these policies may impact the number of overdoses, but there is no clear evidence to suggest that it reduces opioid misuse.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beaudoin FL ; Banerjee GN ; Mello MJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5055/jom.2016.0322 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects\r\nCause of Death\r\nDrug Overdose/mortality/*prevention & control\r\nDrug Prescriptions\r\n*Health Policy/legislation & jurisprudence\r\nHumans\r\nInappropriate Prescribing/mortality/prevention & control\r\nModels, Organizational\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/mortality/*prevention & control\r\nPatient Safety\r\nPolicy Making\r\nPractice Patterns, Physicians'/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & \r\n      administration\r\nPrescription Drug Misuse/mortality/prevention & control\r\nRegional Health Planning/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & \r\n      administration\r\nRisk Assessment\r\nRisk Factors\r\n*State Government\r\nState Health Plans/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization & administration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beaudoin FL, Banerjee GN, and Mello MJ (2016) State-level and system-level opioid prescribing policies: The impact on provider practices and overdose deaths, a systematic review..

Simulation models have been developed to capture and identify ways to manage this complexity and to evaluate the potential costs of different strategies to reduce overdoses and OUD. A review of simulation-based economic evaluations is warranted to fully characterize this set of literature. Methods: A systematic review of simulation-based economic evaluation (SBEE) studies in opioid research was initiated by searches in PubMed, EMBASE, and EbscoHOST. Extraction of a predefined set of items and a quality assessment were performed for each study. Results: The screening process resulted in 23 SBEE studies ranging by year of publication from 1999 to 2019. Methodological quality of the cost analyses was moderately high. The most frequently evaluated strategies were methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments; the only harm reduction strategy explored was naloxone distribution. These strategies were consistently found to be cost-effective, especially naloxone distribution and methadone maintenance. Prevention strategies were limited to abuse-deterrent opioid formulations. Less than half (39%) of analyses adopted a societal perspective in their estimation of costs and effects from an opioid-related intervention.

DESIGN: Prospective, multiple-dose, open label, randomized, non-inferiority, cross-over study over two 11-week periods. Methadone treatment was switched to SROM with flexible dosing and vice versa according to period and sequence of treatment. SETTING: Fourteen out-patient addiction treatment centres in Switzerland and Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with opioid dependence in methadone maintenance programmes (dose ≥50 mg/day) for ≥26 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The efficacy end-point was the proportion of heroin-positive urine samples per patient and period of treatment. Each week, two urine samples were collected, randomly selected and analysed for 6-monoacetyl-morphine and 6-acetylcodeine. Non-inferiority was concluded if the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) in the difference of proportions of positive urine samples was below the predefined boundary of 10%. FINDINGS: One hundred and fifty-seven patients fulfilled criteria to form the per protocol population. The proportion of heroin-positive urine samples under SROM treatment (0.20) was non-inferior to the proportion under methadone treatment (0.15) (least-squares mean difference 0.05; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.08; P > 0.01). The 95% CI fell within the 10% non-inferiority margin, confirming the non-inferiority of SROM to methadone. A dose-dependent effect was shown for SROM (i.e. decreasing proportions of heroin-positive urine samples with increasing SROM doses). Retention in treatment showed no significant differences between treatments (period 1/period 2: SROM: 88.7%/82.1%, methadone: 91.1%/88.0%; period 1: P = 0.50, period 2: P = 0.19). Overall, safety outcomes were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Slow-release oral morphine appears to be at least as effective as methadone in treating people with opioid use disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beck T ; Haasen C ; Verthein U ; Walcher S ; Schuler C ; Backmund M ; Ruckes C ; Reimer J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.12440 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nCodeine/analogs & derivatives/urine\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMaintenance Chemotherapy\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nMorphine Derivatives/urine\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nDose-response\r\nmaintenance treatment\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid addiction\r\nretention rate\r\nslow-release oral morphine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beck T, Haasen C, Verthein U, Walcher S, Schuler C, Backmund M, Ruckes C, and Reimer J (2014) Maintenance treatment for opioid dependence with slow-release oral morphine: a randomized cross-over, non-inferiority study versus methadone..

Heroin addiction is strongly associated with deviant behaviour and crime, and the objectives in treating heroin addiction have been a blend of humane support, rehabilitation, public health intervention and crime control. Reduction in street heroin use is the foundation on which all these outcomes are based. The pharmacological basis of maintenance treatment of dependent individuals is to minimize withdrawal symptoms and attenuate the reinforcing effects of street heroin, leading to reduction or cessation of street heroin use. Opioid maintenance treatment can be moderately effective in suppressing heroin use, although deviations from evidence-based approaches, particularly the use of suboptimal doses, have meant that treatment as delivered in practice may have resulted in poorer outcomes than predicted by research. Methadone treatment has been 'programmatic', with a one-size-fits-all approach that in part reflects the perceived need to impose discipline on deviant individuals. However, differences in pharmacokinetics and in side-effects mean that many patients do not respond optimally to methadone. Injectable diamorphine (heroin) provides a more reinforcing medication for some 'nonresponders' and can be a valuable option in the rehabilitation of demoralized, socially excluded individuals. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist, is a less reinforcing medication with different side-effects and less risk of overdose. Not only is it a different medication, but also it can be used in a different paradigm of treatment, office-based opioid treatment, with less structure and offering greater patient autonomy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bell J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/bcp.12051 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/administration & dosage\r\nDrug Overdose\r\nHeroin/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nReinforcement, Psychology\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nTime Factors\r\naddiction\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nheroin\r\nmethadone","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bell J (2014) Pharmacological maintenance treatments of opiate addiction..

Most studies prescribed pharmaceutical heroin (diacetyl morphine, or DAM). This paper critically reviews randomised trials, long-term follow-up studies and qualitative reports of SIOT, and briefly reviews evidence regarding other medications used in injectable treatment as an alternative to DAM. It seeks to identify critical, unresolved issues regarding this treatment. Randomised trials comparing DAM with oral methadone (OM) report that while in treatment, participants randomised to DAM used less street heroin; reported spending less money on drugs, committed fewer crimes, and experienced improved health. Similar findings pertain to SIOT with hydromorphone. Because of the risks of overdose, diversion, and misuse, all recent trials of injected DAM involved supervised administration. This contributes to treatment being expensive to deliver. There is conflicting evidence regarding societal cost effectiveness, with some studies estimating that the reduction in crime more than compensates for the expense of the treatment. The critical, unresolved issues concerning this modality of treatment relate to the way in which it is approached-either as a medium-term, intensive intervention where other treatment has failed, designed to bring people into conventional opioid agonist treatment (OAT); or an indefinite support aimed at reducing social and personal harm. The former seems in line with the available findings on long-term effectiveness of SIOT and might be more acceptable given its rather moderate cost.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bell J ; Belackova V ; Lintzeris N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40265-018-0962-y ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nDrug Overdose/prevention & control\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHeroin/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/prevention & control\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bell J, Belackova V, and Lintzeris N (2018) Supervised Injectable Opioid Treatment for the Management of Opioid Dependence..

Medications demonstrated to be effective for OUD are methadone (a full opioid agonist), buprenorphine (a partial agonist), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Methadone and buprenorphine act by suppressing opioid withdrawal symptoms and attenuating the effects of other opioids. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid agonists. Oral methadone has the strongest evidence for effectiveness. Longer duration of treatment allows restoration of social connections and is associated with better outcomes. Treatments for OUD may be limited by poor adherence to treatment recommendations and by high rates of relapse and increased risk of overdose after leaving treatment. Treatment with methadone and buprenorphine has the additional risk of diversion and misuse of medication. New depot and implant formulations of buprenorphine and naltrexone have been developed to address issues of safety and problems of poor treatment adherence. For people with OUD who do not respond to these treatments, there is accumulating evidence for supervised injectable opioid treatment (prescribing pharmaceutical heroin). Another medication mode of minimizing risk of overdose is take-home naloxone. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose, and take-home naloxone programs aim to prevent fatal overdose. All medication-assisted treatment is limited by lack of access and by stigma. In seeking to stem the rising toll from OUD, expanding access to approved treatment such as methadone, for which there remains the best evidence of efficacy, may be the most useful approach.","Comments":"2019-11-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bell J ; Strang J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.06.020","Keywords":"drug implant\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nopiate\r\nclinical outcome\r\ncomparative effectiveness\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug formulation\r\ndrug overdose\r\ndrug safety\r\nheart ventricle tachycardia\r\nhuman\r\nmedication compliance\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\nprescription drug diversion\r\npriority journal\r\nQT prolongation\r\nrelapse\r\nrespiration depression\r\nreview\r\nrisk benefit analysis\r\nsocial interaction\r\nstigma\r\nsystematic review\r\ntorsade de pointes\r\ntreatment duration\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bell J, and Strang J (2020) Medication Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder.

We describe a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of an antiretroviral DOT program in methadone maintenance clinics. Our objective was to determine if DOT is more efficacious than self-administered antiretroviral therapy for reducing HIV viral load, improving adherence, and reducing drug resistance among opioid dependent drug users receiving methadone treatment. METHODS: Participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) or antiretroviral DOT for the 24-week intervention. TAU participants received standard adherence counseling, and DOT participants received standard adherence counseling plus directly observed antiretroviral therapy, which was delivered at the same time as they received daily methadone. Assessments occurred at baseline, weekly for 8 weeks, and then monthly for 4 months. Our primary outcomes were between-group changes from baseline to the end of the intervention in: HIV viral load, antiretroviral adherence, and number of viral mutations. RESULTS: Between June 2004 and August 2007, we screened 3231 methadone-maintained patients and enrolled 77; 39 participants were randomized to DOT and 38 to TAU. 65 completed the 24-week intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial will allow rigorous evaluation of the efficacy of directly observed antiretroviral therapy delivered in methadone clinics for improving adherence and clinical outcomes. This detailed description of trial methodology can serve as a template for the development of future DOT programs and can guide protocols for studies among HIV-infected drug users receiving methadone for opioid dependence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Berg KM ; Mouriz J ; Li X ; Duggan E ; Goldberg U ; Arnsten JH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2009.05.003 ","Keywords":"Ambulatory Care Facilities\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nAnti-HIV Agents/*therapeutic use\r\n*Directly Observed Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHIV Infections/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMass Screening\r\nMedication Adherence/statistics & numerical data\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nSample Size\r\nSelf Administration\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/epidemiology\r\nUnited States/epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Berg KM, Mouriz J, Li X, Duggan E, Goldberg U, and Arnsten JH (2009) Rationale, design, and sample characteristics of a randomized controlled trial of directly observed antiretroviral therapy delivered in methadone clinics..

Twin studies of opioid addiction are consistent with an inherited component of risk, approximately 50%. Several genome-wide association study (GWAS) reports indicate that genetic risk for opioid addiction is conveyed by many alleles of small effect (odds ratios <1.5). These reports have detected alleles in potassium-ion-channel genes (KCNC1 and KCNG2) and in a glutamate receptor auxiliary protein (CNIH3). Additionally, a variant at the µ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), which regulates OPRM1 expression appears promising. In pharmacogenetics of opioid addictions, methadone dose may be regulated by variants in cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6), a methadone-metabolizing enzyme, and by a locus 300 kb 5' to OPRM1. A δ-opioid-receptor gene single-nucleotide polymorphism may predict treatment response to methadone versus buprenorphine.

There is an assumption that full adherence is needed to achieve ideal treatment outcomes, and that non-adherence is associated with ongoing opioid use. However, literature documenting the strength of that assertion is lacking.Objectives: Evaluate the association between daily buprenorphine adherence and illicit opioid use.Methods: Secondary analysis of a 12-week randomized controlled trial of adults with opioid use disorder who recently initiated buprenorphine. Weekly study visits included self-report of daily buprenorphine adherence over the past 7 days (Timeline Follow Back method) and urine drug tests (UDT). A log-linear regression model accounting for clustering by participant was used to assess the association between buprenorphine adherence and illicit opioid use. Buprenorphine adherence was measured as a continuous variable (0-7 days).Results: Among 78 participants (56 men, 20 women, 2 nonbinary) with 737 visits, full 7-day adherence was reported at 70% of visits. The predominant form of non-adherence was missed doses (92% of cases). Each additional day of adherence was associated with an 8% higher rate of negative UDT for illicit opioids (RR = 1.08; 95% CI:1.03-1.13, p = .0002).Conclusion: In this sample of participants starting buprenorphine, missed doses were not uncommon. Fewer missed days was significantly associated with a lower risk of illicit opioid use. These findings suggest that efforts to minimize the number of missed days of buprenorphine are beneficial for treatment outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bhatraju EP ; Radick AC ; Leroux BG ; Kim TW ; Samet JH ; Tsui JI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2023.2220876 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nMale\r\nHumans\r\nFemale\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/urine\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nMedication adherence\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nopioid related disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bhatraju EP, Radick AC, Leroux BG, Kim TW, Samet JH, and Tsui JI (2023) Buprenorphine adherence and illicit opioid use among patients in treatment for opioid use disorder..

A long-acting naltrexone formulation may be beneficial. This study evaluated the effects of extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX), targeted for a one-month duration of action, in blocking opioid agonist challenge effects in humans. Methods: Outpatient non-dependent opioid abusers (N= 27) were randomly assigned to a single double-blind IM administration of 75, 150, or 300. mg XR-NTX. To assess the extent of opioid blockade, hydromorphone challenges (0, 3, 4.5, 6. mg IM in ascending order at 1-h intervals [up to 13.5. mg total]) were given at pretreatment baseline and on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 56. Opioid blockade was assessed via (1) tolerability of the ascending hydromorphone doses; (2) visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of subjective opioid effects and (3) pupil diameter. Effects on the VAS and pupils were assessed via the slope of the time-action function over ascending hydromorphone doses, with zero slope indicating complete blockade. Results: Blockade of the VAS \" any drug effect\" response to 3. mg hydromorphone was complete for 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively, for the XR-NTX doses of 75, 150, and 300. mg. Subjective effects were more readily blocked than was pupil constriction. Higher hydromorphone doses produced only modest increases in agonist effects. With the 300. mg XR-NTX dose the slope of VAS responses remained at or near zero for one month even with maximal cumulative hydromorphone dosing. Conclusions: These data quantify the month-long opioid blockade underlying XR-NTX's efficacy in opioid dependence treatment. © 2011.","Comments":"2012-05-31","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bigelow G E; Preston K L; Schmittner J ; Dong Q ; Gastfriend D R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.10.018","Keywords":"hydromorphone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\nclinical evaluation\r\ncontrolled release formulation\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndisease severity\r\ndose response\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug blood level\r\ndrug delivery system\r\ndrug dose comparison\r\ndrug effect\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug monitoring\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\ninjection site contusion\r\ninjection site induration\r\ninjection site reaction\r\nmale\r\nmulticenter study\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npriority journal\r\npupil reflex\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nreaction time\r\ntreatment duration\r\nvisual analog scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bigelow G E, Preston K L, Schmittner J, Dong Q, and Gastfriend D R (2012) Opioid challenge evaluation of blockade by extended-release naltrexone in opioid-abusing adults: Dose-effects and time-course.

METHODS: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, ASSIA and Science Direct databases were searched for papers from 1995 to the present relevant to the abuse of prescribed opiate medication. Identified journals and their reference lists were hand searched for other relevant articles. Of the abstracts identified as relevant, full text papers were retrieved and critiqued against the inclusion criteria for the review. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-five abstracts were identified, leading to 42 full-text articles being retrieved. Of those, 10 papers were included in the review. Significant differences in abuse behaviours between different countries were reported. However, a key theme emerged from the data regarding a culture of nasal administration of prescribed sublingual buprenorphine within some prisons due to both reduced prevalence of injection within prison and reduced supplies of illicit drugs within prison. The buprenorphine/naloxone preparation appears to be less amenable to abuse. The review highlighted a paucity of empirical research pertaining to both prevalence of the phenomenon and treatment responses. CLINICAL AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: Healthcare providers within prisons need to prescribe opioids in the least abuseable preparation since the risk of abuse is significant, despite widespread processes of supervised dispensing. Prescription medication abuse is not limited to opioids and the predominant drug of abuse in an individual prison can rapidly change according to availability.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bi-Mohammed Z ; Wright NM ; Hearty P ; King N ; Gavin H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.11.032 ","Keywords":"Administration, Sublingual\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Prescriptions\r\nHumans\r\nIllicit Drugs/adverse effects\r\nNarcotics/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods/trends\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nPrescription Drug Misuse/prevention & control/*trends\r\nPrevalence\r\nPrisons/*trends\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Abuse\r\n*Abuse of prescribed medication\r\n*Buprenorphine\r\n*Buprenorphine/Naloxone\r\n*Diversion\r\n*Methadone\r\n*Misuse\r\n*Opioid\r\n*OxyContin\r\n*Oxycodone\r\n*Prison\r\n*Prisoner","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bi-Mohammed Z, Wright NM, Hearty P, King N, and Gavin H (2017) Prescription opioid abuse in prison settings: A systematic review of prevalence, practice and treatment responses..

We conducted a literature review to assess and critically examine the methodologies used in MOUD treatment studies. Methods: Published studies in English that examined MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or extended-release naltrexone) were included (N = 20). The methods and frequencies of measuring primary opioid outcomes, including urine drug tests (UDTs) and self-report of opioid use were compared among studies. Results: A total of 20 studies fit the inclusion criteria. Each study assessed opioid use; only 12 had opioid use as a primary outcome. Other primary outcomes included retention in treatment (N = 6), and two had other primary outcomes (death and opioid withdrawal symptoms). Opioid use was assessed through both self-report and UDTs in 15 studies. Two studies did not use UDTs. Differences were found in the methods used for how opioid use, retention in treatment, self-report of opioid use, and UDTs were measured. Discussion and Conclusions: The different primary outcomes used and operational definitions in each study make comparisons between studies difficult. The use of both self-report and UDTs for opioid use has several advantages, and if possible, researchers should use both measures. Scientific Significance: This is the first review critically examining outcome measures from MOUD treatment studies. Creating a standard for opioid treatment outcomes in MOUD studies will allow for generalizable results that can inform both researchers and clinicians to better care for those with OUD.

Methods: Data from two double-blind placebo-controlled trials of XR-NTX among persons with HIV and alcohol or opioid use disorders leaving the criminal justice system (CJS) were analyzed for gender differences among clinical characteristics, mental health, drug use severity, and other domains. The study that recruited persons with alcohol use disorder (AUD) was conducted from September 2010-February 2016 at two sites in Connecticut (CT), and the opioid use disorder (OUD) study was conducted from September 2010-March 2016 at three sites in CT and one site in Massachusetts. Results: Baseline data were analyzed from 193 participants consented to be randomized to XR-NTX or placebo; 40 women and 153 men. Women were younger, had worse mental health severity, and were more likely to be diagnosed with cocaine use disorder. There were no statistical differences between men and women in the prescription of antiretroviral therapy (ART) or ART adherence. Conclusions: Women had greater mental health severity and a higher prevalence of cocaine use as compared to men, both of which are known to be barriers to engagement and retention on medication treatment for alcohol and opioid use disorders. For women with CJS involvement and living with HIV and SUDs, understanding factors that may affect initiation and retention on medication treatment of SUDs are necessary to improve treatment outcomes in women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Biondi BE ; Frank CA ; Forray A ; Springer SA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/08897077.2021.1900984 ","Keywords":"Criminal Law\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\n*HIV Infections/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nSex Factors\r\nHIV\r\nalcohol use disorder\r\ncriminal justice system\r\nextended-release naltrexone\r\nopioid use disorder\r\nwomen","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Biondi BE, Frank CA, Forray A, and Springer SA (2021) Gender differences among criminal justice-involved persons living with HIV interested in extended-release naltrexone treatment..

We examined whether dronabinol, a cannabinoid receptor type 1 partial agonist, reduces opioid withdrawal and increases retention in treatment with extended release naltrexone (XR-naltrexone). Methods: Opioid dependent participants were randomized to receive dronabinol 30. mg/d (. n=. 40) or placebo (. n=. 20), under double-blind conditions, while they underwent inpatient detoxification and naltrexone induction. Before discharge all participants received an injection of XR-naltrexone, with an additional dose given four weeks later. Dronabinol or placebo was given while inpatient and for 5 weeks afterwards. The primary outcomes were the severity of opioid withdrawal, measured with the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale, and retention in treatment at the end of the inpatient phase and at the end of the 8-week trial. Results: The severity of opioid withdrawal during inpatient phase was lower in the dronabinol group relative to placebo group (. p=. 0.006). Rates of successful induction onto XR-naltrexone (dronabinol 66%, placebo 55%) and completion of treatment (dronabinol 35%, placebo 35%) were not significantly different. Post hoc analysis showed that the 32% of participants who smoked marijuana regularly during the outpatient phase had significantly lower ratings of insomnia and anxiety and were more likely to complete the 8-week trial. Conclusion: Dronabinol reduced the severity of opiate withdrawal during acute detoxification but had no effect on rates of XR-naltrexone treatment induction and retention. Participants who elected to smoke marijuana during the trial were more likely to complete treatment regardless of treatment group assignment.","Comments":"2015-08-18","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bisaga A ; Sullivan M A; Glass A ; Mishlen K ; Pavlicova M ; Haney M ; Raby W N; Levin F R; Carpenter K M; Mariani J J; Nunes E V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.05.013","Keywords":"dronabinol\r\nnaltrexone\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\ncannabis smoking\r\nchill\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled clinical trial\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndecreased appetite\r\ndetoxification\r\ndiarrhea\r\ndisease severity\r\ndose response\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nsomnolence\r\ndrug dose increase\r\ndrug response\r\ndrug safety\r\nface edema\r\nfatigue\r\nfemale\r\ngastrointestinal symptom\r\nheadache\r\nhuman\r\nhyperhidrosis\r\nincreased appetite\r\ninsomnia\r\nmale\r\nmood change\r\nnausea\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\npriority journal\r\npruritus\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nunspecified side effect\r\nvomiting\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bisaga A, Sullivan M A, Glass A, Mishlen K, Pavlicova M, Haney M, Raby W N, Levin F R, Carpenter K M, Mariani J J, and Nunes E V (2015) The effects of dronabinol during detoxification and the initiation of treatment with extended release naltrexone.

SETTING: Outpatient treatment in MMT- or specialized HAT-centers in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic, treatment-refractory heroin dependent patients (n=73). STUDY PARAMETERS: General craving for heroin (Obsessive Compulsive Drug Use Scale); self-reported illicit heroin use; multi-domain treatment response in physical, mental and social health and illicit drug use. FINDINGS: The course of heroin craving and illicit heroin use differed significantly, with strong reductions in HAT but not in MMT. General heroin craving was significantly related to illicit heroin use. Heroin craving was not and illicit heroin use was marginally related to multi-domain treatment response, but only in MMT and not in HAT. CONCLUSIONS: Heroin craving and illicit heroin use were significantly associated and both strongly decreased in HAT but not in MMT. Craving was not related to multi-domain treatment response and illicit heroin use was marginally related to treatment response in MMT, but not in HAT. The latter was probably due to the strong reduction in illicit heroin use in most patients in HAT and the small sample size of the sub-study. It is hypothesized that the strong reductions in craving for heroin in HAT are related to the stable availability of prescribed, pharmaceutical grade heroin.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Blanken P ; Hendriks VM ; Koeter MW ; van Ree JM ; van den Brink W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.06.025 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nPatient Compliance/psychology\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Blanken P, Hendriks VM, Koeter MW, van Ree JM, and van den Brink W (2012) Craving and illicit heroin use among patients in heroin-assisted treatment..

DESIGN: Multi-center, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Twelve specialized addiction treatment centers for HAT in The Netherlands; April 2006-January 2011. PARTICIPANTS: 214 chronic, treatment-refractory heroin dependent patients in HAT, with frequent cocaine use. INTERVENTIONS: Routine, daily supervised diacetylmorphine treatment, co-prescribed with oral methadone (HAT), with and without 6 months contingency management for cocaine use as an add-on intervention; HAT+CM and HAT-only, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was the longest, uninterrupted duration of cocaine abstinence, based upon laboratory urinalysis. Secondary outcome measures included other cocaine-related measures, treatment retention in HAT, and multi-domain health-related treatment response. FINDINGS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, HAT+CM was more effective than HAT-only in promoting longer, uninterrupted duration of cocaine abstinence (3.7 weeks versus 1.6 weeks; negative binomial regression: Exp(B)=2.34, 95%-CI: 1.70-3.23; p<0.001). This result remained significant in sensitivity analyses and was supported by all secondary, cocaine-related outcome measures. Treatment retention in HAT was high (91.6%) with no difference between the groups. The improvement in multi-domain health-related treatment response during the trial was numerically higher in HAT+CM (from 37.4% to 53.1%; +15.7%) than in HAT-only (from 44.5% to 46.5%; +2.0%), but this difference was statistically not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Contingency management is an effective add-on intervention to promote longer, uninterrupted periods of cocaine abstinence in chronic, treatment-refractory heroin dependent patients in heroin-assisted treatment with frequent cocaine use.

Treatment facilities are now open in most parts of Sweden. At the addiction medicine unit in Jönköping, high dose buprenorphine has been used since 1999, and methadone was added in 2005, when the previously separate regulations for the use of those two substances were merged in the present regulations. ADHD and ADD, together with OCD, are relatively common disorders among drug addicts. Since 2004 we have diagnosed over 150 patients with these disorders at the addiction medicine unit. By November 2007, treatment with long-acting methylphenidate or modafinil had been initiated in 85 subjects. Of those 85, 12 had also met the criteria for opioid substitution. This paper will discuss our experiences with the combined treatment with opioids and central stimulants, as administered to those drug addicts. In this naturalistic study, all 12 subjects (1 female), mean age 38 (range 20 to 51) were evaluated before starting Central Stimulant (CS) treatment with clinical interviews, self-assessments and formal computerized tests (EuroCog). The ambition is to follow each patient's development through the use of drug tests, interviews (subjects and relatives/significant others), and a retest to evaluate the outcome of the combined treatment.","Comments":"2009-05-12","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Blix O ; Dalteg A ; Nilsson P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ncentral stimulant agent\r\nmethadone\r\nmethylphenidate\r\nmodafinil\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\nattention disturbance\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical assessment\r\nclinical assessment tool\r\ncognition\r\ncomorbidity\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug megadose\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\ninterview\r\nlearning\r\nmale\r\nmemory\r\nmental disease\r\nnaturalistic inquiry\r\nneuropsychological assessment\r\nobsessive compulsive disorder\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npriority journal\r\npsychotherapy\r\nquestionnaire\r\nreaction time\r\nself evaluation\r\nself report\r\nsocial support\r\nSweden\r\nsubutex","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Blix O, Dalteg A, and Nilsson P (2009) Treatment of opioid dependence and ADHD/ADD with opioid maintenance and central stimulants.

A total of 34 eligible studies were included. Overall, co-occurring substance use was associated with negative treatment outcomes regardless of intervention type. However, patterns varied by substance and intervention type. In particular, co-occurring use of cocaine or marijuana with opioids was associated with reduced treatment retention and opioid abstinence regardless of intervention type. Co-occurring use of amphetamines, compared with no use or reduced use of amphetamines, decreased treatment retention. Co-occurring use of alcohol was both positively and negatively associated with treatment outcomes. One study reported a significant positive association between sedative use and opioid abstinence. Generally, findings suggest that combined interventions reported better health outcomes compared with pharmacological or behavioral intervention studies alone. The findings of this review emphasize the need to comprehensively study and address co-occurring substance use to improve opiate treatment programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Blondino CT ; Gormley MA ; Taylor DDH ; Lowery E ; Clifford JS ; Burkart B ; Graves WC ; Lu J ; Prom-Wormley EC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/epirev/mxaa005 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nbehavioral intervention\r\nco-occurring substance use\r\nopiate treatment programs\r\nopioid abstinence\r\nopioids\r\npharmacological intervention\r\npolysubstance use\r\ntreatment retention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Blondino CT, Gormley MA, Taylor DDH, Lowery E, Clifford JS, Burkart B, Graves WC, Lu J, and Prom-Wormley EC (2020) The Influence of Co-Occurring Substance Use on the Effectiveness of Opiate Treatment Programs According to Intervention Type..

This pilot feasibility study aimed to evaluate early caloric enhancement on weight patterns among infants born to women receiving methadone maintenance therapy while pregnant. METHODS: In this double-blind pilot feasibility study, we randomly assigned infants with fetal methadone exposure to 24 or 20 kcal/oz formula from days 3 to 21. Randomization was stratified by any breastfeeding, sex of the infant, and gestational age. Eligible infants were ≥35 weeks' gestation and weighed ≥2200 g. Outcomes were days to weight nadir, maximum percent weight loss, days to birth weight, percentage weight change per day, and feasibility. RESULTS: A total of 49 infants were randomly assigned (22 to standard- and 27 to high-calorie formula); groups had comparable demographic characteristics. Main outcomes comparing standard- to high-calorie formula groups were not significant (days to weight nadir, 5.0 vs 4.4 days; P = .20; maximum percent weight loss, -9.4% vs -8.6%; P = .15; days to birth weight, 14.7 vs 13.6 days; P = .07); however, in longitudinal analyses (days 4 to 21), the high-calorie group had a higher percent weight gained per day compared with the standard-calorie group (P <.001). There were high levels of protocol adherence, and no adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that early initiation of high-calorie formula for infants with prenatal methadone exposure may be beneficial for weight gain; evaluation in a larger study is warranted.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bogen DL ; Hanusa BH ; Baker R ; Medoff-Cooper B ; Cohlan B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1542/hpeds.2017-0114 ","Keywords":"Double-Blind Method\r\n*Energy Intake\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Infant Formula\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nIntention to Treat Analysis\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/adverse effects\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*therapy\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/drug therapy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nWeight Gain","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bogen DL, Hanusa BH, Baker R, Medoff-Cooper B, and Cohlan B (2018) Randomized Clinical Trial of Standard- Versus High-Calorie Formula for Methadone-Exposed Infants: A Feasibility Study..

Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis on the effects of incarceration-based OST on substance use, treatment engagement post-release and re-incarceration. Method: We searched for studies on individuals who were incarcerated and treated with OST, compared to a comparison group. Studies were only included if they reported data post-release. Results: N = 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found less opioid use, less other drug use, higher treatment engagement post-release and less re-incarceration among treated individuals compared to the comparison group. Moderator analyses showed some influence of length of follow-up period and study quality. Conclusions: Incarceration-based OST reduces drug use, re-incarceration and leads to higher treatment engagement after release. More research is needed on the effects of incarceration-based OST on secondary outcomes (e.g. health and social integration) and on factors that moderate these effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Boksán K ; Dechant M ; Weiss M ; Hellwig A ; Stemmler M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/00258024221118971 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Prisoners\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nincarcerated populations\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nopioid substitution treatment\r\ntreatment of incarcerated individuals","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Boksán K, Dechant M, Weiss M, Hellwig A, and Stemmler M (2023) A meta-analysis on the effects of incarceration-based opioid substitution treatment..

Objective: To examine the association of contingency management, a behavioral intervention wherein patients receive material incentives contingent on objectively verified behavior change, with end-of-treatment outcomes for these comorbid behavioral problems. Data Sources: A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and reference sections of articles from inception through May 5, 2020. The following search terms were used: vouchers OR contingency management OR financial incentives. Study Selection: Prospective experimental studies of monetary-based contingency management among participants receiving MOUD. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline, 3 independent investigators extracted data from included studies for a random-effects meta-analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was the association of contingency management at end-of-treatment assessments with 6 clinical problems: stimulant use, polysubstance use, illicit opioid use, cigarette smoking, therapy attendance, and medication adherence. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to compute weighted mean effect size estimates (Cohen d) and corresponding 95% CIs separately for each clinical problem and collapsing across the 3 categories assessing abstinence and the 2 assessing treatment adherence outcomes. Results: The search identified 1443 reports of which 74 reports involving 10444 unique adult participants met inclusion criteria for narrative review and 60 for inclusion in meta-analyses. Contingency management was associated with end-of-treatment outcomes for all 6 problems examined separately, with mean effect sizes for 4 of 6 in the medium-large range (stimulants, Cohen d = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.49-0.92]; cigarette use, Cohen d = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.43-1.14]; illicit opioid use, Cohen d = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.30-0.86]; medication adherence, Cohen d = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.30-1.21]), and 2 in the small-medium range (polysubstance use, Cohen d = 0.46 [95% CI, 0.30-0.62]; therapy attendance, d = 0.43 [95% CI, 0.22-0.65]). Collapsing across abstinence and adherence categories, contingency management was associated with medium effect sizes for abstinence (Cohen d = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.47-0.69) and treatment adherence (Cohen d = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.84) compared with controls. Conclusions and Relevance: These results provide evidence supporting the use of contingency management in addressing key clinical problems among patients receiving MOUD, including the ongoing epidemic of comorbid psychomotor stimulant misuse. Policies facilitating integration of contingency management into community MOUD services are sorely needed.","Comments":"2023-11-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bolívar H A; Klemperer E M; Coleman S R.M; DeSarno M ; Skelly J M; Higgins S T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.1969","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nlevacetylmethadol\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nadult\r\nbehavior change\r\ncigarette smoking\r\nCochrane Library\r\ncomorbidity\r\ncontrolled study\r\neconomic incentive\r\neffect size\r\nhuman\r\nmedication compliance\r\nMedline\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\npractice guideline\r\nprospective study\r\nquality control\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\nWeb of Science","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bolívar H A, Klemperer E M, Coleman S R.M, DeSarno M, Skelly J M, and Higgins S T (2021) Contingency Management for Patients Receiving Medication for Opioid Use Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

The patient-centered access to healthcare framework posits access as a multidimensional phenomenon impacted by five healthcare system and five patient ability dimensions. Interventions to improve local MOUD treatment outcomes require an understanding of how these dimensions differ across urban and rural communities. This scoping review sought to systematically appraise the literature on MOUD access across urban and rural communities (i.e., rurality) in the US using the patient-centered access framework. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of 1) electronic databases, 2) grey literature, and 3) correspondence with content experts (March 2021). We included articles specifying the study sample by rurality and examining at least one dimension of access to MOUD. The analysis and qualitative synthesis of study results examined study characteristics and categorized key findings by access dimensions. RESULTS: The search produced 3963 unique articles, of which 147 met inclusion criteria. Among included studies, 96% (142/147) examined healthcare system dimensions of access while less than 20% (25/147) examined any of the five dimensions of patient ability. Additionally, 49% (72/147) of studies compared access dimensions by rurality. Across studies, increasing rurality was associated with fewer available MOUD services, but little was known about geographic variation in other critical dimensions of access. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of studies examined healthcare system dimensions of MOUD access and few studies made comparisons by rurality or prioritized the patient's perspective, limiting our understanding of how access differs by rurality in the US. As COVID-19 spurs novel changes in MOUD delivery, this inadequate multidimensional understanding of MOUD access may impede the tailoring of interventions to local needs. There is an urgent need for mixed-methods and community-engaged research prioritizing the patient's perspective of MOUD access by rurality.

Opioid use disorders among schizophre nia patients are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Studies assessing the efficacy of opioid maintenance therapy, including methadone or buprenorphine, systematically excluded patients with schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses. To our knowledge, no specific study assessed the efficacy of opioid maintenance therapy in subjects with comorbid opioid use disorders and schizophrenia [2]. In a retrospective study, Gerra et al. assessed buprenorphine efficacy in outpatients with psychiatric disorders, including some schizophrenia patients, but the number of subjects included was low (n = 13) [3]. The aim of the present study was to compare clinical and toxicological characteristics in a group of patients with opiate dependence and schizophrenia with a group of patients with opiate dependence without schizophrenia. Both groups received treat ment with methadone or buprenorphine. Methods: The sociodemographic, clinical and toxicological characteristics of a group of 31 outpatients with severe opiate use disorders and schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, according to the DSM-5 criteria were compared with those of a group of 31 outpatients with severe opiate use disorders without schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, matched for age and sex. The patients were recruited from the substance abuse department at Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris. The Chi-2 test was used to compare the categorical variables. Student's t-test was used to compare the qualitative variables. Results: The mean age of the patients was 45.2 years. There were seven female subjects in the two groups (22.6%). There were no differences between the two groups regarding age (45.2 ± 7.9 vs 45.1 ± 9.0 years, respectively, t =-0.03, NS), marital status rates (80.6% vs 87.1% respectively Chi-2 = 0.477, NS), employ ment rates (51.6% vs 19.4%, Chi-2 = 7.04, NS), or mean age of onset of opiate use disorders (34.8 ± 7.8 vs 34.2 ± 8.5 years, respectively, t =-0, 28, NS). The mean age of first psychiatric treatment was lower in the group of patients with opiate use disorders and schizophrenia than in their counterparts without schizophrenia (mean age: 27.2 ± 8.3 vs 34.3 ± 8.8 years respect-ively, t =-3, 2, p = 0.002). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding positive urine screening tests rates for opiates (67.7% vs 54.8%, respectively, Chi-2 = 1, 088, NS), cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis or benzodiazepines. The mean frequency of visits in the substance abuse department was higher in the group of patients with schizophrenia (22.5 ± 12.1 vs 15.7 ± 7.2 consultations/6 months respectively, p = 0.009). Conclusions: In line with the review by Mattick et al. on opioid maintenance therapy for opioid use disorders, this preliminary study suggests that the efficacy of opioid maintenance therapy for opioid use disorders is similar in patients with severe opiate use disorders and schizophrenia as in patients with severe opiate use disorders without psychotic disorder, as verified by toxicological urine analysis [2]. In this study, the patients with severe opiate use disorders and schizophrenia were treated earlier than in their counterparts without schizophrenia. The results of the present study were consistent with those of Maremmani et al. in patients with bipolar disorders [5].","Comments":"2017-11-22","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bouton J F; Laqueille X ; Bourdel M C; Dervaux A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"amphetamine derivative\r\nbenzodiazepine derivative\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncannabis\r\ncocaine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\nbipolar disorder\r\nchi square test\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical trial\r\ncomparative effectiveness\r\nconsultation\r\ncontrolled clinical trial\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug therapy\r\nDSM-5\r\nfemale\r\nFrance\r\nhuman\r\nhuman tissue\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmarriage\r\nmiddle aged\r\nonset age\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutpatient\r\npsychiatric treatment\r\nretrospective study\r\nschizoaffective psychosis\r\nscreening test\r\nstudent\r\nStudent t test\r\nsubstance abuse\r\ntoxicology\r\nurinalysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bouton J F, Laqueille X, Bourdel M C, and Dervaux A (2017) Opioid maintenance therapy for the treatment of opioid use disorders in outpatients with or without schizophrenia.

Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) has shown to be efficacious in various substance use populations, but has yet to be assessed with MMT clients. Design: The current mixed methods study was designed to inform protocol adaptation for MMT clients and to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MBRP for this population. Subjects: The sample consisted of adults (N = 15) recruited from a methadone clinic to participate in a 6-week MBRP course. Outcome measures: Data from focus groups and course satisfaction surveys supported feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Self-report outcome measures included depression, anxiety, craving, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, and experiential avoidance, and were assessed at baseline and postcourse. Results: Mean scores on all primary outcomes changed in the expected direction at postcourse, and baseline to postcourse changes in depression, craving, and trauma symptoms reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Results from this initial pilot trial support feasibility and acceptability, and provide preliminary data on outcomes for future trials of mindfulness-based approaches within the MMT community.","Comments":"2017-07-31","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bowen S ; Somohano V C; Rutkie R E; Manuel J A; Rehder K L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/acm.2016.0417","Keywords":"methadone\r\nadult\r\naged\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\navoidance behavior\r\nclinical article\r\ncraving\r\ndepression\r\nfeasibility study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\ninformation processing\r\nmale\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmindfulness\r\nmindfulness based relapse prevention\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npatient attitude\r\npatient satisfaction\r\npilot study\r\nposttraumatic stress disorder\r\npriority journal\r\nquality of life\r\nrelapse\r\nself care\r\nself report\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bowen S, Somohano V C, Rutkie R E, Manuel J A, and Rehder K L (2017) Mindfulness-based relapse prevention for methadone maintenance: A feasibility trial.

Treatment for these patients after stabilization often involves the provision of information for outpatient treatment options. Ideally, an ED visit for overdose would present an opportunity to start treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) immediately. Although widely recognized as effective, opioid agonist therapy with methadone and buprenorphine commonly referred to as \"medication-assisted therapy\" but more correctly as \"medication for addiction treatment\" (MAT), can be difficult to access even for motivated individuals due to shortages of prescribers and treatment programs. Moreover, opioid agonist therapy may not be appropriate for all patients, as many patients who present after overdose are not opioid dependent. More treatment options are required to successfully match patients with diverse needs to an optimal treatment plan in order to avoid relapse. Naltrexone, a long-acting opioid antagonist, available orally and as a monthly extended-release intramuscular injection, may represent another treatment option. Methods: We conducted a literature search of MEDLINE and PubMed. We aimed to capture references related to naltrexone and is use as MAT for OUD, as well as manuscripts that discussed naltrexone in comparison toother agents used for MAT, opioid detoxification, and naltrexone metabolism. Our initial search logic returned a total of 618 articles. Following individual evaluation for relevance, we selected 65 for in-depthreview. Manuscripts meeting criteria were examined for citations meriting further review, leading to the addition of 30 manuscripts Conclusions: Here, we review the pharmacology of naltrexone as it relates to OUD, its history of use, and highlight recent studies and new approaches for use of the drug as MAT including its potential initiation after ED visit for opioid overdose.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bradley ES ; Liss D ; Carreiro SP ; Brush DE ; Babu K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15563650.2019.1583342 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/poisoning\r\nDrug Overdose/drug therapy\r\n*Emergency Service, Hospital\r\nHumans\r\nNaltrexone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nNaltrexone\r\nabstinence\r\naddiction\r\nmedication-assisted therapy\r\noverdose","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bradley ES, Liss D, Carreiro SP, Brush DE, and Babu K (2019) Potential uses of naltrexone in emergency department patients with opioid use disorder..

Accordingly, an urgent need exists to improve access to evidence-based treatment for opioid addiction, and also to develop and evaluate alternative treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD). We present a case of a patient with OUD who was successfully switched and managed on oral hydromorphone after development of a prolonged QTc interval on methadone. Case: A 51-year-old man with longstanding polysubstance use presented to an urban hospital in Vancouver, Canada, for management of alcohol intoxication and hyponatremia. At the time of admission, the patient was stable on 100 mg of methadone daily, but was found to have a persistently elevated QTc (>550 milliseconds), putting him at increased risk for Torsades de Pointes. In an effort to find an alternative opioid agonist therapy for maintenance, a trial of slow-release oral morphine was attempted, but discontinued due to the development of myoclonus. Once-daily sustained-release oral hydromorphone was then started, which was found to manage cravings well without notable side effects. Discussion: The case presented offers promise for the use of once-daily sustained-release oral hydromorphone as a viable treatment option for patients with OUD for whom first-line therapies are not suitable or tolerated.

Buprenorphine has emerged as an appealing medication for its use not only as treatment for opioid use disorder, but also as an opioid for chronic pain that has a ceiling effect on risks associated with opioid therapy. As other opioid prescribing decreases, buprenorphine prescribing continues to increase. As a result, it is imperative to understand the safety and efficacy of its use in special populations. This review article will explore the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine when used in subjects with hepatic and renal impairment, the elderly, and pregnant women. While manufacturer labeling for buprenorphine products may caution against their use in these populations, further examination of available data indicates that buprenorphine can be used safely and effectively for both chronic pain and/or opioid use disorder in all four of these populations.","Comments":"2023-02-22","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brandt C ; Atkinson T J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.amjms.2022.06.025","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nefavirenz\r\nnorbuprenorphine\r\ndepression\r\ndrug absorption\r\ndrug bioavailability\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug formulation\r\ndrug metabolism\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nheart rate\r\nhemodialysis\r\nhighly active antiretroviral therapy\r\nintoxication\r\nkidney disease\r\nlactation\r\nliver failure\r\nmaximum plasma concentration\r\nopiate addiction\r\npolypharmacy\r\npregnancy\r\npregnant woman\r\nprescription\r\nrespiration depression\r\nreview\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brandt C, and Atkinson T J (2022) A review of the safety of buprenorphine in special populations.

Measuring HRQoL represents an opportunity to consider outcomes of opioid use disorder treatment that are more patient-centered and more relevant to overall health than abstinence alone. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore the extent to which the collection of HRQoL by opioid treatment programs is documented in the treatment program literature. Materials and methods We searched PubMed, Embase PsycINFO and Web of Science for papers published between 1965 and 2015 that reported HRQoL outcome measures from substance abuse treatment programs. Results Of the 3014 unduplicated articles initially identified for screening, 99 articles met criteria for further review. Of those articles, 7 were unavailable in English; therefore 92 articles were reviewed. Of these articles, 44 included any quality-of-life measure, 17 of which included validated HRQoL measures, and 10 supported derivation of quality-adjusted life year utility weights. The most frequently used validated measure was the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Non-U.S. and more recent studies were more likely to include a measure of HRQoL. Conclusions HRQoL measures are rarely used as outcomes in opioid treatment programs. The field should incorporate HRQoL measures as standard practice, especially measures that can be used to derive utility weights, such as the SF-12 or EQ-5D. These instruments provide policy makers with evidence on the impact of programs on patients' lives and with data to quantify the value of investing in opioid use disorder treatments.","Comments":"2017-04-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bray J W; Aden B ; Eggman A A; Hellerstein L ; Wittenberg E ; Nosyk B ; Stribling J C; Schackman B R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2017.01.019","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nmethadone\r\nAddiction Severity Index\r\narticle\r\nclinical outcome\r\nhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npriority journal\r\npsychopharmacotherapy\r\nquality adjusted life year\r\nquality of life\r\nSymptom Checklist 90\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bray J W, Aden B, Eggman A A, Hellerstein L, Wittenberg E, Nosyk B, Stribling J C, and Schackman B R (2017) Quality of life as an outcome of opioid use disorder treatment: A systematic review.

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are a commonly used evidence-based approach to treating affected individuals, but little is known about its use in the rural US. We reviewed published literature and summarized access, barriers, and approaches to MOUD delivery in rural areas. METHODS: We conducted a search using databases in EBSCOhost, such as Academic Search Complete, Medline, and APA PsycArticles, using a priori aims. Articles published after 2004 were included if they were cross-sectional, analyzed secondary data, collected quantitative or qualitative primary data, were longitudinal or reported intervention results. Studies were excluded if they were conducted outside the US or did not present data. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles met all criteria. Themes from the articles included increase in rural areas with waivered physicians able to prescribe buprenorphine, barriers to physician prescribing, waivered physicians choosing not to prescribe, and inability to assess quality of MOUD practices in rural US settings. CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies of MOUD delivery in rural areas are needed to help explicate themes found in this review. Having a stronger understanding of prescribers operating practices and program roll-out in rural areas may help address some identified barriers and deliver a stronger quality treatment practice for individuals with substance-use disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bresett JW ; Kruse-Diehr AJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10826084.2022.2149244 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nUnited States\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Physicians\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nMOUD\r\nopioids\r\nrural","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bresett JW, and Kruse-Diehr AJ (2023) Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Rural United States: A Critical Review of the Literature, 2004-2021..

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is an effective way to address opioid use disorder and prevent overdose; however, few jails and prisons in the United States initiate or continue people who are incarcerated on MMT. In the current study, the 12 month outcomes of a randomized control trial in which individuals were provided MMT while incarcerated at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) are assessed. An as-treated analysis included a total of 179 participants-128 who were, and 51 who were not, dosed with methadone the day before they were released from the RIDOC. The results of this study demonstrate that 12 months post-release individuals who received continued access to MMT while incarcerated were less likely to report using heroin and engaging in injection drug use in the past 30 days. In addition, they reported fewer non-fatal overdoses and were more likely to be continuously engaged in treatment in the 12-month follow-up period compared to individuals who were not receiving methadone immediately prior to release. These findings indicate that providing incarcerated individuals continued access to MMT has a sustained, long-term impact on many opioid-related outcomes post-release.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brinkley-Rubinstein L ; McKenzie M ; Macmadu A ; Larney S ; Zaller N ; Dauria E ; Rich J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2017.11.023 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHeroin Dependence/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods/psychology/*trends\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology\r\n*Prisoners/psychology\r\nPrisons/*trends\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nRhode Island/epidemiology\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/epidemiology/prevention & control/psychology\r\n*Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/epidemiology/psychology\r\nTime Factors\r\nUnited States\r\nIncarceration\r\nMethadone maintenance treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brinkley-Rubinstein L, McKenzie M, Macmadu A, Larney S, Zaller N, Dauria E, and Rich J (2018) A randomized, open label trial of methadone continuation versus forced withdrawal in a combined US prison and jail: Findings at 12 months post-release..

Prenatal buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) versus methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) may improve neonatal outcomes, but associations vary. To summarize evidence, we used a random-effects meta-analysis model and estimated summary measures of BMT versus MMT on several outcomes. Sensitivity analyses evaluated confounding, publication bias, and heterogeneity. Subjects were 515 neonates whose mothers received BMT and 855 neonates whose mothers received MMT and who were born from 1996 to 2012 and who were included in 12 studies. The unadjusted NAS treatment risk was lower (risk ratio = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 0.98) and mean length of hospital stay shorter (-7.23 days, 95% CI: -10.64, -3.83) in BMT-exposed versus MMT-exposed neonates. In treated neonates, NAS treatment duration was shorter (-8.46 days, 95% CI: -14.48, -2.44) and morphine dose lower (-3.60 mg, 95% CI: -7.26, 0.07) in those exposed to BMT. BMT-exposed neonates had higher mean gestational age and greater weight, length, and head circumference at birth. Fewer women treated with BMT used illicit opioids near delivery (risk ratio = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.70). Simulations suggested that confounding by indication could account for some of the observed differences. Prenatal BMT versus MMT may improve neonatal outcomes, but bias may contribute to this protective association. Further evidence is needed to guide treatment choices.","Comments":"2015-06-18","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Brogly S B; Saia K A; Walley A Y; Du H M; Sebastiani P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/aje/kwu190","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nillicit drug\r\nmethadone\r\nmorphine\r\nbirth weight\r\nbody height\r\nfemale\r\ngestational age\r\nhead circumference\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nlength of stay\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\npregnancy outcome\r\npremature labor\r\nprenatal drug exposure\r\npublishing\r\nquality control\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment duration\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brogly S B, Saia K A, Walley A Y, Du H M, and Sebastiani P (2014) Prenatal buprenorphine versus methadone exposure and neonatal outcomes: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

These patients present unique challenges to perioperative pain management. RECENT FINDINGS: Standard opioid-based analgesic techniques are often not sufficient when patients are maintained on medications used to manage opioid addiction. The current recommendations to support perioperative pain management plans in this population are based on a number of case reports and the shared experience of clinicians with success in treating these patients. SUMMARY: When possible, patients maintained on buprenorphine should be evaluated preoperatively to assess the feasibility of discontinuing the buprenorphine 72 h before surgery. If buprenorphine is continued during the perioperative period, patients may require significantly increased doses of standard opioids for analgesia. Patients maintained on methadone are at increased risk for respiratory-related complications and should receive a higher level of monitoring during the perioperative period. Patients who are on chronic methadone should continue their maintenance dose during the perioperative period. Where possible, nonopioid medications and regional anesthetic blockade are effective alternatives for analgesia in this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bryson EO ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ACO.0000000000000052 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*therapy\r\nPain Management/methods\r\nPerioperative Care/*methods","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bryson EO (2014) The perioperative management of patients maintained on medications used to manage opioid addiction..

Untreated OUD is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality-notably, overdose, infectious complications of injecting drug use, and profoundly diminished quality of life. Withdrawal management and medication tapers are ineffective and are associated with increased rates of relapse and death. Pharmacotherapy is the evidence based mainstay of OUD treatment, and many studies support its integration into primary care settings. Evidence is strongest for the opioid agonists buprenorphine and methadone, which randomized controlled trials have shown to decrease illicit opioid use and mortality. Discontinuation of opioid agonist therapy is associated with increased rates of relapse and mortality. Less evidence is available for the opioid antagonist extended release naltrexone, with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showing decreased illicit opioid use but no effect on mortality. Treating OUD in primary care settings is cost effective, improves outcomes for both OUD and other medical comorbidities, and is highly acceptable to patients.

Our aim was to evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of these three methods of intervening on opioid dependence in the ED. DESIGN: Measured health-care use was converted to dollar values. We considered a health-care system perspective and constructed cost-effectiveness acceptability curves that indicate the probability each treatment is cost-effective under different thresholds of willingness-to-pay for outcomes studied. SETTING: An urban ED in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Opioid-dependent patients aged 18 years or older. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported 30-day assessment data were used to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for patient engagement in formal addiction treatment at 30 days and the number of days illicit opioid-free in the past week. FINDINGS: Considering only health-care system costs, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicate that at all positive willingness-to-pay values, ED-initiated buprenorphine treatment was more cost-effective than brief intervention or referral. For example, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1000 for 30-day treatment engagement, we are 79% certain ED-initiated buprenorphine is most cost-effective compared with other studied treatments. Similar results were found for days illicit opioid-free in the past week. Results were robust to secondary analyses that included patients with missing cost data, included crime and patient time costs in the numerator, and to changes in unit price estimates. CONCLUSION: In the United States, emergency department-initiated buprenorphine intervention for patients with opioid dependence provides high value compared with referral to community-based treatment or combined brief intervention and referral.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Busch SH ; Fiellin DA ; Chawarski MC ; Owens PH ; Pantalon MV ; Hawk K ; Bernstein SL ; O'Connor PG ; D'Onofrio G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13900 ","Keywords":"*Aftercare\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\n*Emergency Service, Hospital\r\nHealth Services/economics/*statistics & numerical data\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/economics/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/economics/*therapy\r\nPatient Participation\r\n*Primary Health Care\r\nReferral and Consultation\r\nUnited States\r\nBuprenorphine\r\ncost analysis\r\nemergency department\r\nhealth services research\r\nopiates\r\nscreening","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Busch SH, Fiellin DA, Chawarski MC, Owens PH, Pantalon MV, Hawk K, Bernstein SL, O'Connor PG, and D'Onofrio G (2017) Cost-effectiveness of emergency department-initiated treatment for opioid dependence..

AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of supervised injectable heroin and injectable methadone with optimised oral methadone for chronic refractory heroin addiction. METHOD: Multisite, open-label, randomised controlled trial. Outcomes were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Economic perspective included health, social services and criminal justice resources. RESULTS: Intervention costs over 26 weeks were significantly higher for injectable heroin (mean £8995 v. £4674 injectable methadone and £2596 oral methadone; P<0.0001). Costs overall were highest for oral methadone (mean £15 805 v. £13 410 injectable methadone and £10 945 injectable heroin; P = n.s.) due to higher costs of criminal activity. In cost-effectiveness analysis, oral methadone was dominated by injectable heroin and injectable methadone (more expensive and less effective). At willingness to pay of £30 000 per QALY, there is a higher probability of injectable methadone being more cost-effective (80%) than injectable heroin. CONCLUSIONS: Injectable opioid treatments are more cost-effective than optimised oral methadone for chronic refractory heroin addiction. The choice between supervised injectable heroin and injectable methadone is less clear. There is currently evidence to suggest superior effectiveness of injectable heroin but at a cost that policy makers may find unacceptable. Future research should consider the use of decision analytic techniques to model expected costs and benefits of the treatments over the longer term.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Byford S ; Barrett B ; Metrebian N ; Groshkova T ; Cary M ; Charles V ; Lintzeris N ; Strang J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1192/bjp.bp.112.111583 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*economics\r\nChronic Disease\r\nCost Savings\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis/statistics & numerical data\r\nCrime/economics/statistics & numerical data\r\nHealth Care Costs/statistics & numerical data\r\nHeroin/administration & dosage/*economics\r\nHeroin Dependence/economics/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nInjections/economics\r\nIntention to Treat Analysis\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*economics\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*economics/methods\r\nOutcome Assessment, Health Care/economics/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nQuality-Adjusted Life Years\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Byford S, Barrett B, Metrebian N, Groshkova T, Cary M, Charles V, Lintzeris N, and Strang J (2013) Cost-effectiveness of injectable opioid treatment v. oral methadone for chronic heroin addiction..

This international study evaluated point-of-care (PoC) HCV RNA diagnostic outreach and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment for individuals receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in community pharmacies. AIMS: We assessed the effectiveness of a roving nurse-led pathway offering PoC HCV RNA testing to OAT clients in community pharmacies relative to conventional care. METHODS: Pharmacies in Scotland, Wales, and Australia were randomised to provide PoC HCV RNA testing or conventional referral. Pharmacists directed OAT clients to on-site nurses (intervention) or local clinics (control). Infected participants were treated with DAAs, alongside OAT. Primary outcome was the number of participants with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR) and analysed using mixed effects logistic regression in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: Forty pharmacies were randomised. The ITT population contained 1410 OAT clients. In the conventional arm (n = 648), 62 (10%) agreed to testing, 17 (27%) were tested, 6 (35%) were positive and 5 (83%) initiated treatment. In the intervention arm (n = 762), 148 (19%) agreed to testing, 144 (97%) were tested, 23 (16%) were positive and 22 (96%) initiated treatment. SVR was obtained by 2 (40%; conventional) and 18 (82%; intervention). Intervention arm participants had higher odds of testing, OR 16.95 (7.07-40.64, p < 0.001); treatment, OR 4.29 (1.43-12.92, p = 0.010); and SVR, OR 8.64 (1.82-40.91, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led PoC diagnosis in pharmacies made HCV care more accessible for OAT clients relative to conventional care. However, strategies to improve testing uptake are required.

Twenty-five studies were identified including eleven scientific abstracts. Multiple studies suggest that buprenorphine induction improves engagement in substance treatment up to 30 days after ED treatment. Many different induction protocols were presented, but no particular approach was best supported as criteria for induction and initial dosing vary widely. Similarly, transition of care models focused on either a “hub and spoke” model or “warm hand-offs” model, but no studies compared these approaches. Common barriers to implementing induction programs were provider inexperience, discomfort with addiction treatment, and limited time during the ED visit. No studies described the number of EDs offering induction. While ED buprenorphine induction is safe and enhances adherence to addiction treatment, uncertainty persists in how to best identify patients needing treatment, how to initiate buprenorphine, and how to enhance follow-up after ED-initiated treatment.","Comments":"2021-04-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cao S S; Dunham S I; Simpson S A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2147/OAEM.S267416","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nclonidine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nclinical protocol\r\nconstipation\r\nsomnolence\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug overdose\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nemergency ward\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nfollow up\r\nheadache\r\nhealth program\r\nhuman\r\nmedical care need\r\nmedical practice\r\nnausea\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient assessment\r\npatient care\r\npatient compliance\r\npractice guideline\r\nprescription\r\nreview\r\nrisk factor\r\nsystematic review\r\nvomiting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cao S S, Dunham S I, and Simpson S A (2020) Prescribing buprenorphine for opioid use disorders in the ed: A review of best practices, barriers, and future directions.

Dihydrocodeine (DHC) substitution treatment is typically low threshold and therefore has the capacity to reach wider groups of opiate users. Decisions to prescribe DHC to patients with less severe opiate disorders centre on its perceived safety, reduced toxicity, shorter half-life and more rapid onset of action, and potential retention of patients. This review set out to investigate the effects of DHC in comparison to other pharmaceutical opioids and placebos in the detoxification and substitution of individuals with opiate use disorders. Objectives: To investigate the effectiveness of DHC in reducing illicit opiate use and other health-related outcomes among adults compared to other drugs or placebos used for detoxification or substitution therapy. Search methods: In February 2019 we searched Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. We also searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and Trialsjournal.com. All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effect of DHC for detoxification and maintenance substitution therapy for adolescent (aged 15 years and older) and adult illicit opiate users. The primary outcomes were abstinence from illicit opiate use following detoxification or maintenance therapy measured by self-report or urinalysis. The secondary outcomes were treatment retention and other health and behaviour outcomes. Data collection and analysis: We followed the standard methodological procedures that are outlined by Cochrane. This includes the GRADE approach to appraise the quality of evidence. Main results: We included three trials (in five articles) with 385 opiate-using participants that measured outcomes at different follow-up periods in this review. Two studies with 150 individuals compared DHC with buprenorphine for detoxification, and one study with 235 participants compared DHC to methadone for maintenance substitution therapy. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to risk of bias and imprecision. For the two studies that compared DHC to buprenorphine, we found low-quality evidence of no significant difference between DHC and buprenorphine for detoxification at six-month follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 1.39; P = 0.23) in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome of abstinence from illicit opiates. Similarly, low-quality evidence indicated no difference for treatment retention (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.68; P = 0.06). In the single trial that compared DHC to methadone for maintenance substitution therapy, the evidence was also of low quality, and there may be no difference in effects between DHC and methadone for reported abstinence from illicit opiates (mean difference (MD) −0.01, 95% CI −0.31 to 0.29). For treatment retention at six months' follow-up in this single trial, the RR calculated with an intention-to-treat analysis also indicated that there may be no difference between DHC and methadone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16). The studies that compared DHC to buprenorphine reported no serious adverse events, while the DHC versus methadone study reported one death due to methadone overdose. Authors' conclusions: We found low-quality evidence that DHC may be no more effective than other commonly used pharmacological interventions in reducing illicit opiate use. It is therefore premature to make any conclusive statements about the effectiveness of DHC, and it is suggested that further high-quality studies are conducted, especially in low- to middle-income countries.","Comments":"2020-03-04","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carney T ; Van Hout M C; Norman I ; Dada S ; Siegfried N ; Parry C D.H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD012254.pub2","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ndihydrocodeine\r\nmethadone\r\ndrug dependence\r\ndrug detoxification\r\ndrug traffic\r\nfinancial management\r\nfollow up\r\ngroups by age\r\nhealth status\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nself report\r\nsystematic review\r\ntherapy effect\r\ntreatment duration\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carney T, Van Hout M C, Norman I, Dada S, Siegfried N, and Parry C D.H (2020) Dihydrocodeine for detoxification and maintenance treatment in individuals with opiate use disorders.

This multicenter pragmatic trial compared the effectiveness of methadone treatment between two induction models: primary care (PC) and SC. METHODS: In this study, registered at ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT00657397), opioid-dependent individuals not on methadone treatment for at least one month or receiving buprenorphine but needing to switch were randomly assigned to start methadone in PC (N = 155) or in SC (N = 66) in 10 sites in France. Visits were scheduled at months M0, M3, M6 and M12. The primary outcome was self-reported abstinence from street-opioids at 12 months (M12) (with an underlying 15% non-inferiority hypothesis for PC). Secondary outcomes were abstinence during follow-up, engagement in treatment (i.e. completing the induction period), retention and satisfaction with the explanations provided by the physician. Primary analysis used intention to treat (ITT). Mixed models and the log-rank test were used to assess the arm effect (PC vs. SC) on the course of abstinence and retention, respectively. RESULTS: In the ITT analysis (n = 155 in PC, 66 in SC), which compared the proportions of street-opioid abstinent participants, 85/155 (55%) and 22/66 (33%) of the participants were classified as street-opioid abstinent at M12 in PC and SC, respectively. This ITT analysis showed the non-inferiority of PC (21.5 [7.7; 35.3]). Engagement in treatment and satisfaction with the explanations provided by the physician were significantly higher in PC than SC. Retention in methadone and abstinence during follow-up were comparable in both arms (p = 0.47, p = 0.39, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Under appropriate conditions, methadone induction in primary care is feasible and acceptable to both physicians and patients. It is as effective as induction in specialized care in reducing street-opioid use and ensuring engagement and retention in treatment for opioid dependence.

As its prevalence increases, this provides a valuable opportunity for clinicians in the hospital setting to engage and initiate management and treatment of OUD. PURPOSE: This article aims to provide hospitalists and other clinicians working in the hospital with a narrative review of the management of opioid withdrawal and the initiation of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the hospital and provide an update on a novel low dose approach to buprenorphine induction (also commonly referred to as the 'microinduction' method). METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review of the literature. RESULTS: Management can initially include treating withdrawal symptoms with opioids as well as with a combination of non-opioid medications such as alpha 2 agonists, benzodiazepines, and/or antiemetics as needed. Besides simply managing withdrawal symptoms, clinicians can further improve the care of patients with OUD through initiating maintenance treatment with MOUD, ideally with opioids used in the initial management of withdrawal. Opioid detoxification is an inferior method of primary treatment and is associated with relapse and poor outcomes. In contrast, treatment with MOUD using methadone or buprenorphine is associated with superior treatment outcomes and reduced relapse compared to detoxification alone. Treatment with MOUD using methadone or buprenorphine can be successfully used in the hospital setting. A novel low dose approach to buprenorphine induction may be useful in minimizing precipitated withdrawals in patients who have recently used or received opioids, which makes this an attractive option in the hospital where patients are frequently on opioids for acutely painful conditions. The hospital setting also provides a valuable opportunity for clinicians to address harm reduction in patients with OUD. Finally, clinicians can improve the long-term outcomes of patients with OUD by ensuring a smooth discharge with adequate and timely follow-up. CONCLUSION: Proper management of opioid withdrawal and initiation of MOUD in the hospital can improve outcomes in patients with OUD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carswell N ; Angermaier G ; Castaneda C ; Delgado F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/21548331.2022.2102776 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\n*Antiemetics/therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nHospitals\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nRecurrence\r\n*Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nUnited States\r\nAddiction\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ninpatient\r\nmethadone\r\nmicroinduction\r\nopioid\r\nopioid use disorder\r\nopioid-related disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carswell N, Angermaier G, Castaneda C, and Delgado F (2022) Management of opioid withdrawal and initiation of medications for opioid use disorder in the hospital setting..

Those analyses considered patients who were clinically-stable and primarily abused prescription opioids. However, a large proportion of OUD patients are treatment-naive and primarily abuse heroin, and are traditionally more difficult to treat owing to higher rates of relapse and treatment discontinuation. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we report an economic model comparing BSI versus SL-BPN, XR-NTX, and MTD for OUD among this more difficult to treat subgroup. METHODS: Outcomes from OUD clinical trials populated a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) to derive odds abstinence on therapy. This included 8 trials of SL-BPN, MTD, and XR-NTX and 2 BSI trials that enrolled cohorts who were primarily treatment-naive and primarily abused heroin. NMA outcomes were used in a Markov model simulating cohort progression for 12 months (cycled monthly) through four mutually-exclusive health states: on therapy (1) with or (2) without illicit opioid use, (3) off therapy with illicit opioid use, and (4) death. In each health state, cohorts accumulated direct medical costs associated with drug acquisition, administration, diversion/misuse, and relapse; and indirect costs associated with death, lost productivity, and accidental pediatric exposure. Event risks and costs not derived from the NMA were literature based. The impact of underlying model uncertainty on outcomes was assessed by deterministic, probabilistic, and scenario sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: BSI was also the economically advantageous therapy at a total annual cost of $23,917 versus SL-BPN ($25,723), MTD ($27,384), and XR-NTX ($35,878). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the primary driver of total annual cost-other than efficacy-was drug acquisition cost, which was the second largest contributor of costs following relapse-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits. CONCLUSIONS: BSI was more effective and less costly than SL-BPN, MTD, and XR-NTX to treat OUD among higher risk patients. The outcomes should be interpreted somewhat cautiously given that they were based on an economic model and not entirely on direct observation in a real-world treatment setting. Nevertheless, these findings have important implications for budget-constrained providers and policymakers seeking to ameliorate the intensifying opioid abuse epidemic.","Comments":"2018-11-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Carter J ; Dammerman R ; Frost M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nabstinence\r\nbudget\r\nchild\r\nclinical trial (topic)\r\nconference abstract\r\ndeath\r\ndisease simulation\r\ndriver\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\neconomic model\r\nemergency ward\r\nepidemic\r\nfemale\r\nhealth status\r\nhigh risk patient\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nimplant\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\nnetwork meta-analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\nrelapse\r\nrisk assessment\r\nsensitivity analysis\r\nsystematic review\r\nuncertainty","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Carter J, Dammerman R, and Frost M (2017) Economic analysis of buprenorphine subdermal implant versus standards of care for primarily treatment-naive primarily heroin-addicted patients with opioid use disorder.

While buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone are currently indicated as first-line medications for the treatment of OUD, there are a proportion of individuals who do not benefit from these therapies. Recent Canadian guidelines suggest the use of alternate therapies, including slow-release oral morphine or injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) for individuals unsuccessful with either methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone. While the guidelines highlight the need to intensify OUD treatment as disease severity increases, equally important is the consideration for deintensification of treatment (eg, from iOAT to an oral opioid agonist treatment (OAT) option) following successful stabilisation. Literature addressing how best to accomplish this, however, is currently lacking. Accordingly, the case presented here describes a patient that successfully transitions from iOAT to oral buprenorphine/naloxone using a novel induction approach termed microdosing.","Comments":"2020-04-22","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Caulfield M D.G; Brar R ; Sutherland C ; Nolan S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bcr-2019-233715","Keywords":"buprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ncocaine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nhydromorphone\r\nmethadone\r\nmethamphetamine\r\nmorphine\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nbody weight gain\r\ncase report\r\nclinical article\r\ncocaine dependence\r\ndepression\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug dose increase\r\ndrug dose titration\r\ndrug microdose\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhuman\r\ninsomnia\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmale\r\nmethamphetamine dependence\r\nmiddle aged\r\npriority journal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Caulfield M D.G, Brar R, Sutherland C, and Nolan S (2020) Transitioning a patient from injectable opioid agonist therapy to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of opioid use disorder using a microdosing approach.

METHODS: This study of 69 opioid-dependent youths is a secondary analysis of data collected during a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Clinical Trials Network study. Outpatients aged 15-21 were randomized to a 12-week buprenorphine-naloxone dosing condition (including 4 weeks of taper). Predictors of dosing included sociodemographic characteristics (gender, race, age, and education), substance use (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, and nicotine use), and clinical characteristics (pain and withdrawal severity). RESULTS: Most (75.4%) reported having either \"some\" (n=40, 58.0%) or \"extreme\" (n=12, 17.4%) pain on enrollment. Maximum daily dose of buprenorphine-naloxone (19.7 mg) received by patients reporting \"extreme\" pain at baseline was significantly higher than the dose received by patients reporting \"some\" pain (15.0mg) and those without pain (12.8 mg). In the adjusted analysis, only severity of pain and withdrawal significantly predicted dose. During the dosing period, there were no significant differences in opioid use, as measured by urinalysis, by level of pain. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the presence of pain predicts buprenorphine-naloxone dose levels in opioid-dependent youth, and that patients with pain have comparable opioid use outcomes to those without pain, but require higher buprenorphine-naloxone doses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chakrabarti A ; Woody GE ; Griffin ML ; Subramaniam G ; Weiss RD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.10.014 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAge Factors\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nData Interpretation, Statistical\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaloxone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (U.S.)\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nOutpatients\r\nPain/chemically induced\r\nPain Measurement\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/prevention & control\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chakrabarti A, Woody GE, Griffin ML, Subramaniam G, and Weiss RD (2010) Predictors of buprenorphine-naloxone dosing in a 12-week treatment trial for opioid-dependent youth: secondary analyses from a NIDA Clinical Trials Network study..

The on-going opioid crisis, and more recently COVID-19, has prompted reconsideration of these restrictions in order to sustain and improve treatment access, with renewed interest in telemedicine. We reviewed the evidence on use of telemedicine interventions and applicability to MOUD policy changes in the post-COVID-19 treatment landscape. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases were searched from inception to April 2021 and reference lists were reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies were eligible if they examined telemedicine interventions and reported outcomes (e.g. treatment initiation, retention in care). Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized; other studies were included when stronger evidence was unavailable. One investigator abstracted key information and a second investigator verified data. We described the results qualitatively. Results: We identified nine studies: three controlled trials (two randomized), and six observational studies. Three studies evaluated patients treated with methadone and six studies with buprenorphine, including one study of pregnant women with OUD. All studies showed telemedicine approaches associated with similar outcomes (treatment retention, positive urine toxicology) compared to treatment as usual. Trials were limited by small samples sizes, lack of reporting harms, and most were conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; observational studies were limited by failure to control for confounding. Conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that telemedicine may enhance access to MOUD with similar effectiveness compared with face-to-face treatment. Few studies have been published since COVID-19, and it is unclear the potential impact of these interventions on the existing racial/ethnic disparities in treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic and need for social distancing led to temporary policy changes for prescribing of MOUD that could inform additional research in this area to support comprehensive policy reforms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chan B ; Bougatsos C ; Priest KC ; McCarty D ; Grusing S ; Chou R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/08897077.2021.1967836 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nPandemics\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nSystematic Reviews as Topic\r\n*Telemedicine\r\nUnited States\r\n*COVID-19 Drug Treatment\r\nCOVID-19\r\nTelemedicine\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chan B, Bougatsos C, Priest KC, McCarty D, Grusing S, and Chou R (2022) Opioid treatment programs, telemedicine and COVID-19: A scoping review..

Objective: To examine study retention in a trial of within-prison methadone initiation and a behavioral intervention among incarcerated men with HIV and opioid dependence in Malaysia. Methods: In this 2x2 factorial trial, 296 incarcerated men with HIV and opioid dependence were allocated to (1) an HIV risk reduction intervention, the Holistic Health Recovery Program for Malaysia (HHRP-M), (2) pre-release methadone initiation, (3) both interventions, or (4) standard care (NCT02396979). Here we estimate effects of these interventions on linkage to the study after prison release and completion of post-release study visits. Results: Most participants (68.9%) completed at least one post-release study visit but few (18.6%) completed all 12. HHRP-M was associated with a 13.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8%, 23.2%) increased probability of completing at least one post-release study visit. Although not associated with initial linkage, methadone treatment was associated with an 11% (95% CI: 2.0%, 20.6%) increased probability of completing all twelve post-release study visits. Being subject to forced relocation outside Kuala Lumpur after prison release decreased retention by 43.3% (95% CI: -51.9%, -34.8%). Conclusion: Retaining study participants in HIV clinical trials following prison release is challenging and potentially related to the broader challenges that participants experience during community reentry. Researchers conducting clinical trials with this population may want to consider methadone and HHRP as means to improve post-release retention, even in clinical trials where these interventions are not being directly evaluated.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chandra DK ; Bazazi AR ; Nahaboo Solim MA; Kamarulzaman A ; Altice FL ; Culbert GJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15284336.2019.1603433 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBehavior Therapy\r\n*Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nHIV Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nMalaysia/epidemiology\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nPrisoners/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPrisons/statistics & numerical data\r\nRetention in Care/standards/*statistics & numerical data\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nClinical trials\r\nHIV\r\ncriminal justice\r\nprisoners\r\nstudy retention\r\nsubstance use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chandra DK, Bazazi AR, Nahaboo Solim MA, Kamarulzaman A, Altice FL, and Culbert GJ (2019) Retention in clinical trials after prison release: results from a clinical trial with incarcerated men with HIV and opioid dependence in Malaysia..

However, frequent dosing requirements and potential for misuse and drug diversion contribute to significant complications with treatment adherence for available formulations. Areas covered: This review describes the development of and preliminary data from clinical trials of an implantable buprenorphine formulation. Efficacy and safety data from comparative studies with other administrations of buprenorphine, including tablets and sublingual film, will be described. Key premises of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program for safely administering buprenorphine implants, which all prescribing physicians must complete, are also discussed.

Administration of medication-assisted treatments (MATs) for OUD on an individual-dose basis has been shown to affect patient responses to treatment, proving to be, on occasion, dangerous. A genetic basis has been identified for some MAT responses in a candidate gene context, but consensus has not been reached for any genome-wide significant associations. This systematic review aims to identify and assess any genetic variants associated with MAT patient outcomes at genome-wide significance. Methods: The databases searched by the authors will be: MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL and Pre-CINAHL, GWAS Catalog, GWAS Central, and NIH Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes. A title and abstract screening, full-text screening, data extraction, and quality assessment will be completed in duplicate for each study via Covidence. Treatment outcomes of interest include continued opioid use or abstinence during treatment or at follow-up, time to relapse, treatment retention rates, opioid overdose, other substance use, comorbid psychiatric disorders, risk taking behaviors, MAT plasma concentrations, and mortality rates. Analysis methods applied, if appropriate, will include random effects meta-analysis with pooled odds ratios for all outcomes. Subgroup analyses will also be implemented, when possible. Discussion: This systematic review can hopefully inform the direction of future research, aiding in the development of a safer and more patient-centered treatment. It will be able to highlight genome-wide significant variants that are replicable and associated with MAT patient outcomes. Systematic review registration: This systematic review protocol has been registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration ID CRD42020169121).","Comments":"2020-11-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chawar C ; Hillmer A ; Sanger S ; D'Elia A ; Panesar B ; Guan L ; Xie D X; Bansal N ; Abdullah A ; Kapczinski F ; Pare G ; Thabane L ; Samaan Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13643-020-01461-z","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nclonidine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nfentanyl\r\nhydromorphone\r\nmorphine\r\nnaloxone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nabstinence\r\nall cause mortality\r\nblood level\r\ndrug megadose\r\ndrug therapy\r\nfollow up\r\ngenetic association\r\ngenetic variability\r\ngenome-wide association study\r\ngenotype\r\nhigh risk behavior\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nmedical record\r\nmedication assisted treatment\r\nmental disease\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmortality rate\r\nopiate addiction\r\npharmacogenomics\r\nphenotype\r\npriority journal\r\nrelapse\r\nretention time\r\nreview\r\nself report\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nurinalysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chawar C, Hillmer A, Sanger S, D'Elia A, Panesar B, Guan L, Xie D X, Bansal N, Abdullah A, Kapczinski F, Pare G, Thabane L, and Samaan Z (2020) GWAS-identified genetic variants associated with medication-assisted treatment outcomes in patients with opioid use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.

The potential advantages of tramadol include ease of administration, low abuse potential, and being nonscheduled. This study compared tramadol and buprenorphine for controlling withdrawal symptoms in patients with opioid dependence syndrome. METHODS: Consenting male subjects between 20 and 45 years of age who fulfilled the ICD-10-DCR criteria for opiate dependence syndrome were randomly assigned in a double-blind, double-dummy placebo-controlled trial for detoxification. Those with multiple drug dependence, abnormal cardiac, renal and hepatic functions, psychosis, or organic mental illness were excluded. Assessments included Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Side Effect Check List. Subjects were evaluated daily and study duration was 10 days. RESULTS: Sixty two subjects were enrolled. The mean SOWS and OOWS and VAS were significantly lower in the buprenorphine group on second and third day of detoxification as compared to the tramadol group. Although the retention rate was higher for buprenorphine group throughout the study, when compared with tramadol the difference was not significant on any day. Three subjects in the tramadol group had seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Tramadol was found to have limited detoxification efficacy in moderate to severe opioid withdrawal and substantial risk of seizures as compared to buprenorphine. Further studies are warranted to examine its efficacy in mild opioid withdrawal symptoms and its potential use in outpatient settings where its administration advantages may be valuable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chawla JM ; Pal H ; Lal R ; Jain R ; Schooler N ; Balhara YP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5055/jom.2013.0145 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nChecklist\r\nChi-Square Distribution\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHeroin Dependence/diagnosis/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nIndia\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/*methods\r\nPain Measurement\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/*rehabilitation\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime Factors\r\nTramadol/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chawla JM, Pal H, Lal R, Jain R, Schooler N, and Balhara YP (2013) Comparison of efficacy between buprenorphine and tramadol in the detoxification of opioid (heroin)-dependent subjects..

However, the program faces problems of poor attendance and high rates of continued drug use. We assessed whether a contingency management (CM) intervention implemented by MMT clinic staff could improve treatment attendance and drug abstinence. METHODS: Eight MMT clinics in Guangdong province were randomly selected and divided into two groups. A total of 126 participants (55 in urban clinics and 71 in rural clinics) received CM during a 12-week trial, 120 participants (83 in urban clinics and 37 in rural clinics) received usual treatment (UT). Participants in the CM group had the opportunity to draw for prizes contingent on attending treatment daily and testing negative for morphine. Clinic- and individual-level outcomes were compared between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The retention rate and negative urine testing rate were 14.2% (P=0.010) and 10.7% (P<0.001) higher in the CM group compared to the UT group, respectively. Compared with participants who received UT, CM participants missed on average 7.3 fewer (P=0.008) visits and were 1.91 (95% CI: 1.53-2.39) times more likely to submit a negative urine sample. All clinic- and individual- level effects of the intervention were observed at rural clinics, but the difference in retention rate between urban CM and UT clinics was not significant.

The study objective was to conduct a systematic review of published health-economic models of opioid agonist therapy for non-prescription opioid dependence, to review the different modelling approaches identified, and to inform future modelling studies. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted in March 2015 in eight electronic databases, supplemented by hand-searching reference lists and searches on six National Health Technology Assessment Agency websites. Studies were included if they: investigated populations that were dependent on non-prescription opioids and were receiving opioid agonist or maintenance therapy; compared any pharmacological maintenance intervention with any other maintenance regimen (including placebo or no treatment); and were health-economic models of any type. RESULTS: A total of 18 unique models were included. These used a range of modelling approaches, including Markov models (n = 4), decision tree with Monte Carlo simulations (n = 3), decision analysis (n = 3), dynamic transmission models (n = 3), decision tree (n = 1), cohort simulation (n = 1), Bayesian (n = 1), and Monte Carlo simulations (n = 2). Time horizons ranged from 6 months to lifetime. The most common evaluation was cost-utility analysis reporting cost per quality-adjusted life-year (n = 11), followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (n = 4), budget-impact analysis/cost comparison (n = 2) and cost-benefit analysis (n = 1). Most studies took the healthcare provider's perspective. Only a few models included some wider societal costs, such as productivity loss or costs of drug-related crime, disorder and antisocial behaviour. Costs to individuals and impacts on family and social networks were not included in any model. CONCLUSION: A relatively small number of studies of varying quality were found. Strengths and weaknesses relating to model structure, inputs and approach were identified across all the studies. There was no indication of a single standard emerging as a preferred approach. Most studies omitted societal costs, an important issue since the implications of drug abuse extend widely beyond healthcare services. Nevertheless, elements from previous models could together form a framework for future economic evaluations in opioid agonist therapy including all relevant costs and outcomes. This could more adequately support decision-making and policy development for treatment of non-prescription opioid dependence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chetty M ; Kenworthy JJ ; Langham S ; Walker A ; Dunlop WC ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13722-017-0071-3 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/*economics\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nDrug Overdose/*economics/therapy\r\nHumans\r\n*Models, Economic\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*economics\r\nNonprescription Drugs/*economics\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*economics/therapy\r\nEconomic evaluation\r\nNon-prescription opioid dependence\r\nOpioid agonist maintenance therapy\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chetty M, Kenworthy JJ, Langham S, Walker A, and Dunlop WC (2017) A systematic review of health economic models of opioid agonist therapies in maintenance treatment of non-prescription opioid dependence..

The safety of methadone has been called into question by data indicating a large increase in the number of methadone-associated overdose deaths in recent years that has occurred in parallel with a dramatic rise in the use of methadone for chronic pain. The American Pain Society and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, commissioned an interdisciplinary expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline on safer prescribing of methadone for treatment of opioid addiction and chronic pain. As part of the guideline development process, the American Pain Society commissioned a systematic review of various aspects related to safety of methadone. After a review of the available evidence, the expert panel concluded that measures can be taken to promote safer use of methadone. Specific recommendations include the need to educate and counsel patients on methadone safety, use of electrocardiography to identify persons at greater risk for methadone-associated arrhythmia, use of alternative opioids in patients at high risk of complications related to corrected electrocardiographic QTc interval prolongation, careful dose initiation and titration of methadone, and diligent monitoring and follow-up. Although these guidelines are based on a systematic review, the panel identified numerous research gaps, most recommendations were based on low-quality evidence, and no recommendations were based on high-quality evidence. Perspective This guideline, based on a systematic review of the evidence on methadone safety, provides recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Safe use of methadone requires clinical skills and knowledge in use of methadone to mitigate potential risks, including serious risks related to risk of overdose and cardiac arrhythmias. © 2014 by the American Pain Society.","Comments":"2014-04-15","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chou R ; Cruciani R A; Fiellin D A; Compton P ; Farrar J T; Haigney M C; Inturrisi C ; Knight J R; Otis-Green S ; Marcus S M; Mehta D ; Meyer M C; Portenoy R ; Savage S ; Strain E ; Walsh S ; Zeltzer L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpain.2014.01.494","Keywords":"anti human immunodeficiency virus agent\r\nantiarrhythmic agent\r\nantibiotic agent\r\nanticonvulsive agent\r\nantihistaminic agent\r\natypical antipsychotic agent\r\nbarbituric acid derivative\r\ncitalopram\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate derivative\r\nquinolone derivative\r\nserotonin uptake inhibitor\r\ntricyclic antidepressant agent\r\narticle\r\nchronic pain\r\ndrug dose increase\r\ndrug dose titration\r\ndrug monitoring\r\ndrug overdose\r\ndrug safety\r\nelectrocardiography\r\nfollow up\r\nheart arrhythmia\r\nheart ventricle arrhythmia\r\nhigh risk patient\r\nhuman\r\nloading drug dose\r\nmedical society\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient counseling\r\npatient education\r\npractice guideline\r\nQT prolongation\r\nrecommended drug dose\r\nrespiration depression\r\nsedation\r\nside effect\r\nsystematic review\r\ntorsade de pointes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chou R, Cruciani R A, Fiellin D A, Compton P, Farrar J T, Haigney M C, Inturrisi C, Knight J R, Otis-Green S, Marcus S M, Mehta D, Meyer M C, Portenoy R, Savage S, Strain E, Walsh S, and Zeltzer L (2014) Methadone safety: A clinical practice guideline from the american pain society and college on problems of drug dependence, in collaboration with the heart rhythm society.

To develop a clinical guideline on methadone prescribing to reduce potential harms, the American Pain Society commissioned a review of various aspects related to methadone safety. This article summarizes evidence related to unintentional overdose due to methadone and harms related to cardiac arrhythmia potential. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases through January 2014 for studies assessing harms associated with methadone use; we judged 70 studies to be relevant and to meet inclusion criteria. The majority of studies on overdose and cardiac arrhythmia risk are observational and provide weak evidence on which to base clinical guidelines. In patients prescribed methadone for treatment of opioid dependence, data suggest that mortality benefits related to reduction in illicit drug use outweigh harms. Despite epidemiologic data showing marked increases in the numbers of methadone-related deaths that have been primarily attributed to increased use of methadone for chronic pain, evidence on methadone and mortality risk in this population has been somewhat contradictory. There is some evidence that recent initiation of methadone, psychiatric admissions, and concomitant use of benzodiazepines are associated with a higher risk for overdose. Evidence on cardiac risks is primarily limited to case reports of torsades de pointes, primarily in patients on high doses of methadone, and to studies showing an association between methadone use and prolongation of QTc intervals. Research is needed to understand the effectiveness of dosing methods, electrocardiogram monitoring, and other risk mitigation strategies in patients prescribed methadone. Perspective This systematic review synthesizes the evidence related to methadone use and risk for overdose and cardiac arrhythmia. Findings regarding the association between methadone use and QTc interval prolongation and risk factors for methadone-associated overdose suggest potential targets for risk mitigation strategies, though research is needed to determine the effectiveness of such strategies at reducing adverse outcomes. © 2014 by the American Pain Society.","Comments":"2014-04-15","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chou R ; Weimer M B; Dana T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpain.2014.01.495","Keywords":"benzodiazepine\r\nillicit drug\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nadverse outcome\r\narticle\r\ncancer pain\r\nchronic pain\r\nclinical practice\r\ndrug dependence\r\ndrug dependence treatment\r\ndrug overdose\r\ndrug safety\r\nECG abnormality\r\nelectrocardiography monitoring\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nfollow up\r\nharm reduction\r\nheart arrhythmia\r\nhuman\r\nmedical society\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmortality\r\nopiate addiction\r\npractice guideline\r\nQT prolongation\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrisk factor\r\nrisk management\r\nsudden death\r\nsystematic review\r\ntorsade de pointes\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chou R, Weimer M B, and Dana T (2014) Methadone overdose and cardiac arrhythmia potential: Findings from a review of the evidence for an american pain society and college on problems of drug dependence clinical practice guideline.

Effective and innovative models of care for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in primary care settings (including rural or other underserved settings) could facilitate implementation and enhance provision and uptake of agonist and antagonist pharmacotherapy in conjunction with psychosocial services for more effective treatment of OUDs. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Technical Brief is to describe promising and innovative MAT models of care in primary care settings, describe barriers to MAT implementation, summarize the evidence available on MAT models of care in primary care settings, identify gaps in the evidence base, and guide future research. METHODS: We performed searches in electronic databases from 1995 to mid-June 2016, reviewed reference lists, searched grey literature sources, and interviewed Key Informants. We summarized representative MAT models of care in primary care settings and qualitatively summarized the evidence on MAT models of care in primary care settings and identified areas of future research needs. FINDINGS: We summarized 12 representative MAT models of care in primary care settings, using a framework describing the pharmacological component, the psychosocial services component, the integration/coordination component, and the educational/outreach component. Innovations in MAT models of care include the use of designated nonphysician staff to perform the key integration/coordination role; tiered care models with centralized intake and stabilization of patients with ongoing management in community settings; screening and induction performed in emergency department, inpatient, or prenatal settings with subsequent referral to community settings; community-based stakeholder engagement to develop practice standards and improve quality of care; and use of Internet-based learning networks. Most trials of MAT in primary care settings focus on comparisons of one pharmacological therapy versus another, or on the effectiveness of different intensities or types of psychosocial interventions, rather than on effectiveness of different MAT models of care per se. Key barriers to implementation of MAT models of care include stigma, lack of institutional support, lack of prescribing physicians, lack of expertise, and inadequate reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS: A number of MAT models of care have been developed and implemented in primary care settings. Research is needed to clarify optimal MAT models of care and to understand effective strategies for overcoming barriers to implementation. The models of care presented in this technical brief may help inform the individualized implementation or MAT models of care in different primary care settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Book, Whole","Authors":"Chou R ; Korthuis PT ; Weimer M ; Bougatsos C ; Blazina I ; Zakher B ; Grusing S ; Devine B ; McCarty D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chou R, Korthuis PT, Weimer M, Bougatsos C, Blazina I, Zakher B, Grusing S, Devine B, and McCarty D (2016) Medication-Assisted Treatment Models of Care for Opioid Use Disorder in Primary Care Settings.

Participants received an Internet-based community reinforcement approach intervention plus contingency management (CRA+) and buprenorphine or contingency management alone (CM-alone) plus buprenorphine. The primary outcomes, measured over the course of treatment, were longest continuous abstinence, total abstinence, and days retained in treatment. RESULTS: Compared to those receiving CM-alone, CRA+ recipients exhibited, on average, 9.7 total days more of abstinence (95% confidence interval [CI = 2.3, 17.2]) and had a reduced hazard of dropping out of treatment (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% CI [0.26, 0.85]). Prior treatment for opioid dependence significantly moderated the additional improvement of CRA+ for longest continuous days of abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further evidence that an Internet-based CRA+ treatment is efficacious and adds clinical benefits to a contingency management/medication based program for opioid dependence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Christensen DR ; Landes RD ; Jackson L ; Marsch LA ; Mancino MJ ; Chopra MP ; Bickel WK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/a0037496 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Internet\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Motivation\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\n*Reinforcement, Psychology\r\nResidence Characteristics\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Christensen DR, Landes RD, Jackson L, Marsch LA, Mancino MJ, Chopra MP, and Bickel WK (2014) Adding an Internet-delivered treatment to an efficacious treatment package for opioid dependence..

Breastfeeding is a nonpharmacological intervention that may be beneficial, reducing NAS symptom severity and thus the need for and duration of pharmacological treatment and length of hospital stay. OBJECTIVES: Conduct meta-analysis to determine whether breastfeeding results in better outcomes for NAS infants. Variables included symptom severity, need for and duration of pharmacological treatment, and length of hospital stay. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from 2000 to 2020, and comparative studies examining breastfeeding for NAS infants were extracted. Randomized trials and cohort studies were included. Data were extracted and evaluated with Review Manager Version 5.3. A random-effects model was used to pool discontinuous outcomes using risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Continuous outcomes were evaluated by mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Across 11 studies, 6,375 neonates were included in the meta-analysis. Using a random-effects analysis, breastfeeding reduced initiation of pharmacological treatment, reduced duration of pharmacological treatment, and reduced length of stay. No differences were detected for severity of NAS symptoms. Most studies only reported one to two variables of interest. For most studies, these variables were not the primary study outcomes. All studies were found to be of low risk and good quality based on the Cochrane Risk Assessment Tools. Varying breastfeeding definitions limit generalizability.

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) include: 1) buprenorphine, 2) methadone, and 3) extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Research should investigate patients' and providers' perspectives of MOUD since they can influence prescription, retention, and recovery. Methods: This systematic review focused on patients' and providers' perceptions of MOUD. The review eligibility criteria included inclusion of the outcome of interest, in English, and involving persons ≥18 years. A PubMed database search yielded 1692 results; we included 152 articles in the final review. Results: There were 63 articles about buprenorphine, 115 articles about methadone, and 16 about naltrexone. Misinformation and stigma associated with MOUD were common patient themes. Providers reported lack of training and resources as barriers to MOUD. Conclusion: This review suggests that patients have significant misinformation regarding MOUD. Due to the severity of the opioid epidemic, research must consider the effects of patients' and providers' perspectives on treatment for OUD, including the effects on the type of MOUD prescribed, patient retention and adherence, and ultimately the number of patients treated for OUD, which will aid in curbing the opioid epidemic.","Comments":"2020-12-15","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cioe K ; Biondi B E; Easly R ; Simard A ; Zheng X ; Springer S A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108146","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\narticle\r\nattitude to health\r\nclinical practice\r\ndisease severity\r\nepidemic\r\nhealth education\r\nhuman\r\nmedical decision making\r\nmisinformation\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\nprescription\r\npriority journal\r\nsocial stigma\r\nstigma\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cioe K, Biondi B E, Easly R, Simard A, Zheng X, and Springer S A (2020) A systematic review of patients' and providers' perspectives of medications for treatment of opioid use disorder.

Buprenorphine is a medication designed, researched, and effectively used to assist in OUD recovery. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review discusses an approach to initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) for opioid-abuse recovery. DISCUSSION: Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high affinity and low intrinsic activity. Buprenorphine's long half-life, high potency, and 'ceiling effect' for both euphoric sensation and adverse effects make it an optimal treatment alternative for patients presenting to the ED with opioid withdrawal. While most commonly provided as a sublingual film or tablet, buprenorphine can also be delivered via transbuccal, transdermal, subdermal (implant), subcutaneous, and parenteral routes. Prior to ED administration, caution is recommended to avoid precipitation of buprenorphine-induced opioid withdrawal. Following the evaluation of common opioid withdrawal symptoms, a step-by-step approach to buprenorphine can by utilized to reach a sustained withdrawal relief. A multimodal medication-assisted treatment (MAT) plan involving pharmacologic treatment, as well as counseling and behavioral therapy, is essential to maintaining opioid remission. Patients may be safely discharged with safe-use counseling, close outpatient follow-up, and return precautions for continued management of their OUD. Establishing a buprenorphine program in the ED involves a multifactorial approach to establish a pro-buprenorphine culture. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is an evidence-based, safe, effective treatment option for OUD in an ED-setting. Though successfully utilized by many ED-based treatment programs, the stigma of 'replacing one opioid with another' remains a barrier. Evidence-based discussions on the safety and benefits of buprenorphine are essential to promoting a culture of acceptance and optimizing ED OUD treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cisewski DH ; Santos C ; Koyfman A ; Long B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajem.2018.10.013 ","Keywords":"Behavior Therapy\r\nBuprenorphine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDirective Counseling\r\nDosage Forms\r\n*Emergency Service, Hospital\r\nHumans\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic \r\n      use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy\r\nAddiction\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nMultimodal medication-assisted treatment\r\nOpioid\r\nWithdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cisewski DH, Santos C, Koyfman A, and Long B (2019) Approach to buprenorphine use for opioid withdrawal treatment in the emergency setting..

Opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy, as well as neonatal abstinence syndrome, has quadrupled in the last decade, and opioid maintenance therapy is recommended for pregnant women with OUD. Breastfeeding is an important means of improving outcomes for these vulnerable women and newborns. The purpose of this study was to review current policy on breastfeeding and opioid maintenance therapy, the rates of breastfeeding among women in this population, and facilitators and barriers to implementing policy recommendations. Methods: CINAHL, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Inclusion criteria included publication between 2013 and 2018, English language, human only, and original data (except for policy statements). Studies were excluded if they did not report original data and did not examine breastfeeding for women on opioid maintenance therapy. Results: Eight policy statements and 17 original research studies were identified that met the search criteria. All the policy statements support breastfeeding for women who are stable on opioid maintenance therapy and do not have HIV. Despite this, rates of breastfeeding among women receiving opioid maintenance therapy remain low compared with women in the general population. Results of qualitative research indicates that women on opioid maintenance therapy face numerous barriers to breastfeeding, including misinformation from health care professionals. Quantitative research has only begun to identify interventions to improve breastfeeding outcomes in this population. Research was conducted primarily with white women receiving care at urban health care centers. Discussion: Practice lags behind policy in terms of supporting breastfeeding in women receiving opioid maintenance therapy. There is a need for more research that includes African American and rural women on opioid maintenance therapy, as well as quantitative research that uses findings from qualitative research to identify the best possible interventions for improving breastfeeding outcomes for women on opioid maintenance therapy and their newborns. One significant need is for health care provider education regarding these policies as well as best practices for providing breastfeeding education and support to this population.","Comments":"2019-10-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Clark R R.S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jmwh.12982","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nAfrican American\r\nbreast feeding\r\nclinical outcome\r\nclinical practice\r\nhealth care facility\r\nhealth care personnel\r\nhealth care policy\r\nhealth education\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nnurse\r\nopiate addiction\r\npopulation research\r\nprenatal care\r\npriority journal\r\nqualitative research\r\nquantitative study\r\nreview\r\nrisk factor\r\nrural population\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Clark R R.S (2019) Breastfeeding in Women on Opioid Maintenance Therapy: A Review of Policy and Practice.

The efficacy of low ascending doses of oral NTX vs placebo for patients transitioning from BUP to XR-NTX is evaluated in this study. METHODS: In a phase 3, hybrid residential/outpatient study, clinically stable participants with opioid use disorder (N = 101), receiving BUP for more than or equal to 3 months and seeking antagonist treatment, were randomized (1:1) to 7 residential days of descending doses of BUP and low ascending doses of oral NTX (NTX/BUP, n = 50) or placebo (PBO-N/BUP, n = 51). Both groups received standing ancillary medications and psychoeducational counseling. Following negative naloxone challenge, participants received XR-NTX (day 8). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants who received and tolerated XR-NTX. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between groups for participants receiving a first dose of XR-NTX: 68.6% (NTX/BUP) vs 76.0% (PBO-N/BUP; P = .407). The mean number of days with peak Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score less than or equal to 12 during the treatment period (days 1-7) was similar for NTX/BUP and PBO-N/BUP groups (5.8 vs 6.3; P = .511). Opioid withdrawal symptoms during XR-NTX induction and post-XR-NTX observation period (days 8-11) were mild and similar between groups (mean peak COWS score: NTX/BUP, 5.1 vs PBO-N/BUP, 5.4; P = .464). Adverse events were mostly mild/moderate. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Low ascending doses of oral NTX did not increase induction rates onto XR-NTX compared with placebo. The overall rate of successful induction across treatment groups supports a brief BUP taper with standing ancillary medications as a well-tolerated approach for patients seeking transition from BUP to XR-NTX.

The evidence strongly supports the use of agonist therapies to reduce opioid use and to retain patients in treatment, with methadone maintenance remaining the gold standard of care. Combined buprenorphine/naloxone, however, also demonstrates significant efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability in multiple populations, including youth and prescription opioid-dependent individuals, as does buprenorphine monotherapy in pregnant women. The evidence for antagonist therapies is weak. Oral naltrexone demonstrates poor adherence and increased mortality rates, although the early evidence looks more favorable for extended-release naltrexone, which has the advantages that it is not subject to misuse or diversion and that it does not present a risk of overdose on its own. Two perspectives-individualized treatment and population management-are presented for selecting among the three available Food and Drug Administration-approved maintenance therapies for opioid use disorder.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), but stimulant use may decrease the likelihood of initiating MOUD treatment. Furthermore, trial participants may not represent \"real-world\" populations who would benefit from treatment. METHODS: We conducted a two-stage analysis. First, associations between stimulant use (time-varying urine drug screens for cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamines) and initiation of buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) were estimated across two RCTs (CTN-0051 X:BOT and CTN-0067 CHOICES) using adjusted Cox regression models. Second, results were generalized to three target populations who would benefit from MOUD: Housed adults identifying the need for OUD treatment, as characterized by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); adults entering OUD treatment, as characterized by Treatment Episodes Dataset (TEDS); and adults living in rural regions of the U.S. with high rates of injection drug use, as characterized by the Rural Opioids Initiative (ROI). Generalizability analyses adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, substance use, housing status, and depression between RCT and target populations using inverse probability of selection weighting. RESULTS: Analyses included 673 clinical trial participants, 139 NSDUH respondents (weighted to represent 661,650 people), 71,751 TEDS treatment episodes, and 1,933 ROI participants. The majority were aged 30-49 years, male, and non-Hispanic White. In RCTs, stimulant use reduced the likelihood of MOUD initiation by 32% (adjusted HR [aHR] = 0.68, 95% CI 0.49-0.94, p = 0.019). Stimulant use associations were slightly attenuated and non-significant among housed adults needing treatment (25% reduction, aHR = 0.75, 0.48-1.18, p = 0.215) and adults entering OUD treatment (28% reduction, aHR = 0.72, 0.51-1.01, p = 0.061). The association was more pronounced, but still non-significant among rural people injecting drugs (39% reduction, aHR = 0.61, 0.35-1.06, p = 0.081). Stimulant use had a larger negative impact on XR-NTX initiation compared to buprenorphine, especially in the rural population (76% reduction, aHR = 0.24, 0.08-0.69, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Stimulant use is a barrier to buprenorphine or XR-NTX initiation in clinical trials and real-world populations that would benefit from OUD treatment. Interventions to address stimulant use among patients with OUD are urgently needed, especially among rural people injecting drugs, who already suffer from limited access to MOUD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cook RR ; Foot C ; Arah OA ; Humphreys K ; Rudolph KE ; Luo SX ; Tsui JI ; Levander XA ; Korthuis PT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13722-023-00364-3 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nCocaine\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nGeneralizability\r\nMedications for opioid use disorder\r\nMethamphetamine\r\nStimulants\r\nTransportability","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cook RR, Foot C, Arah OA, Humphreys K, Rudolph KE, Luo SX, Tsui JI, Levander XA, and Korthuis PT (2023) Estimating the impact of stimulant use on initiation of buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone in two clinical trials and real-world populations..

We sought to examine participant retention in care rates of primary care delivered BT programs and to describe factors associated with retention/attrition for participants receiving BT in this setting. Objectives: A PRISMA-guided search of various databases was performed to identify the articles focusing on efficacy of BT treatment and OUD. Method: A systematic literature search identified 15 studies examining retention in care in the primary care setting between 2002 and 2020. Random effects meta-regression were used to identify retention rates across studies. Results: Retention rates decreased across time with a mean 0.52 rate at one year. Several factors were found to be related to retention, including: race, use of other drugs, receipt of counseling, and previous treatment with buprenorphine. Conclusions: While we only investigate BT through primary care, our findings indicate retention rates are equivalent to the rates reported in the specialty care literature. More work is needed to examine factors that may impact primary care delivered BT specifically and differentiate participants that may benefit from care delivered in specialty over primary care as well as the converse.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cooper R L; Edgerton R D; Watson J ; Conley N ; Agee W A; Wilus D M; MacMaster S A; Bell L ; Patel P ; Godbole A ; Bass-Thomas C ; Ramesh A ; Tabatabai M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2023.2251653","Keywords":"adult\r\narticle\r\ncounseling\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug therapy\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\nprimary medical care\r\nrace\r\nretention in care\r\nsystematic review\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nopiate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cooper R L, Edgerton R D, Watson J, Conley N, Agee W A, Wilus D M, MacMaster S A, Bell L, Patel P, Godbole A, Bass-Thomas C, Ramesh A, and Tabatabai M (2023) Meta-analysis of primary care delivered buprenorphine treatment retention outcomes.

We investigated antiretroviral adherence and HIV viral load relative to the number of hours of adherence counseling received by 60 HIV-infected drug users participating in a trial of directly observed antiretroviral therapy delivered in methadone clinics. Our adherence counseling intervention combined motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral counseling, was designed to include six 30 minute individual counseling sessions with unlimited \"booster\" sessions, and was offered to all participants in the parent trial. We found that, among those who participated in adherence counseling, dose of counseling had a significant positive relationship with antiretroviral adherence measured after the conclusion of counseling. Specifically, a liner mixed-effects model revealed that each additional hour of counseling was significantly associated with a 20% increase in post-counseling adherence. However, the number of cumulative adherence counseling hours was not significantly associated with HIV viral load, also measured after the conclusion of counseling. Our findings suggest that more intensive adherence counseling interventions may have a greater impact on antiretroviral adherence than less intensive interventions; however, it remains unknown how much counseling is required to impact HIV viral load.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cooperman NA ; Heo M ; Berg KM ; Li X ; Litwin AH ; Nahvi S ; Arnsten JH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/09540121.2011.644231 ","Keywords":"Anti-HIV Agents/*administration & dosage\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods\r\n*Directly Observed Therapy\r\nDrug Users\r\nFemale\r\nHIV Seropositivity/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/psychology/*statistics & numerical data\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\n*Viral Load","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cooperman NA, Heo M, Berg KM, Li X, Litwin AH, Nahvi S, and Arnsten JH (2012) Impact of adherence counseling dose on antiretroviral adherence and HIV viral load among HIV-infected methadone maintained drug users..

To better help opioid-dependent individuals quit smoking, we developed and pilot-tested an intervention, based in the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of behavior change, which could be tailored to address individual barriers to smoking cessation in this population. METHODS: We randomized participants (n = 83) in methadone treatment to the eight-session, IMB model-based, intervention plus nicotine replacement therapy (intervention, n = 41) or a facilitated referral to the state Quitline (control, n = 42). All participants completed assessments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS: Intervention participants completed a median of five sessions (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8) and had significantly higher intervention satisfaction than control participants. Intervention participants reported smoking significantly fewer cigarettes per day at 3 months (median [IQR] = 6 [4-15]) and 6 months (median [IQR] = 8 [4-14]) as compared control participants at 3 months (median [IQR] = 10 [5-20]) and 6 months (median [IQR] = 10 [6-20]). Fifty-six percent of the intervention group and 41% of the control group a made a quit attempt during the study (p = .16). At 3 months, 7% (n = 3) of intervention participants and none of the control participants were abstinent from smoking (p = .23). At 6 months, 2% of participants in both groups were abstinent. Twenty-four percent and 10% of the intervention and control group participants, respectively, reported 20 or more smoke-free days (p = .43). CONCLUSIONS: An IMB model-based smoking cessation intervention for opioid-dependent smokers is feasible and acceptable in methadone treatment and may help methadone maintained smokers cut down on their smoking. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study of a tailored, IMB Model-based, smoking cessation intervention for opioid dependent smokers. Results showed that opioid dependent smokers are willing and able to participate in an IMB model-based smoking cessation intervention, and this intervention may help this population cut down on their smoking. Also, the Quitline seems less feasible and acceptable for this population than a face-to-face intervention. Further research is needed to determine how to integrate smoking cessation treatment into methadone programs and how to improve interventions so that treatment gains can lead to long-term abstinence in this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cooperman NA ; Lu SE ; Richter KP ; Bernstein SL ; Williams JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ntr/ntx189 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\nBehavior Therapy/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNicotine/administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods/psychology\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology/*therapy\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSmokers/psychology\r\nSmoking Cessation/*methods/psychology\r\nTobacco Use Cessation Devices\r\nTobacco Use Disorder/*epidemiology/psychology/*therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cooperman NA, Lu SE, Richter KP, Bernstein SL, and Williams JM (2018) Pilot Study of a Tailored Smoking Cessation Intervention for Individuals in Treatment for Opioid Dependence..

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills training has shown promise for addressing substance use and a variety of health behaviors and conditions; however, it has never been evaluated for smoking cessation in any population. The objective of this study was to field test a DBT skills training–based intervention for tobacco dependence and opioid relapse prevention (DBT-Quit) among people in methadone treatment. Methods: We recruited seven individuals in methadone treatment to participate in a field test of DBT-Quit. Participants attended 12 weekly 90-minute DBT skills training groups, focusing on mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills. Participants received nicotine patches for eight weeks and completed assessments at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), and 12 weeks (post-treatment). Results: All but one participant (86%, n = 6) attended at least 50% of intervention sessions. Participants were “very” or “mostly” satisfied with the intervention. At 12 weeks, all but one (86%, n = 6) had made a quit attempt, and one (14%) had seven-day point prevalence abstinence. Participants were smoke-free for 24 hours (14%, n = 1), 7 to 14 days (43%, n = 3), and 30 to 59 days (29%, n = 2). Participants smoked significantly fewer cigarettes per day at 6 weeks and 12 weeks as compared to baseline. No participants used illicit drugs. As compared to baseline, at follow-up there were no significant differences in difficulties with emotion regulation, distress tolerance, or mindfulness. Conclusions: A DBT skills training–based intervention for individuals who smoke and have an opioid use disorder is feasible and acceptable in methadone treatment and may help this population prevent drug relapse, attempt to quit smoking, experience smoke-free days, and cut down on their smoking. More research is needed to determine the optimal structure and components of a DBT skills–based intervention for drug relapse prevention and smoking cessation. Further, a randomized controlled trial of DBT-Quit is needed to determine the efficacy of DBT skills training for smoking cessation and drug relapse prevention in this population.","Comments":"2019-06-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cooperman N A; Rizvi S L; Hughes C D; Williams J M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15504263.2018.1548719","Keywords":"methadone\r\nnicotine patch\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ndialectical behavior therapy\r\ndistress syndrome\r\nemotionality\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmindfulness\r\nopiate addiction\r\nrelapse\r\nsmoking cessation\r\ntobacco dependence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cooperman N A, Rizvi S L, Hughes C D, and Williams J M (2019) Field Test of a Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training–Based Intervention for Smoking Cessation and Opioid Relapse Prevention in Methadone Treatment.

METHODS: Randomized individuals in MMT (N = 30) received MORE plus methadone TAU (n = 15) or methadone TAU, only (n = 15). Participants in the MORE arm received their MMT, as usual, and attended eight, weekly, two-hour MORE groups at their MMT clinics. Participants in the TAU arm received their MMT, as usual, and group or individual counseling, as required by the clinic. TAU counseling consisted of relapse prevention, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and supportive treatment. TAU participants did not receive any mindfulness-based intervention. Participants completed assessments at baseline, post-treatment (i.e., 8-weeks post-baseline), and follow-up (i.e., 16-weeks post-baseline). RESULTS: Participants in MORE evidenced significantly fewer baseline adjusted days of illicit drug use and significantly lower levels of craving through 16-week follow-up compared to TAU. Also, Participants in MORE reported significantly lower levels of pain, physical and emotional limitations, depression, and anxiety through 16-week follow-up compared to TAU. Conversely, participants in MORE reported significantly higher levels of well-being, vitality, and social functioning through 16-week follow-up compared to TAU.

DESIGN: Three sites from the Maternal Opioid Treatment: Human Experimental Research (MOTHER) study, a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial participated in this substudy. SETTING: Medical Centers that provided comprehensive maternal care to opioid-dependent pregnant women in Baltimore, MD, Providence, RI and Vienna, Austria. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine full-term infants. MEASUREMENTS: The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) was administered to a subgroup of infants on postpartum days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14-15 and 28-30. FINDINGS: While neurobehavior improved for both medication conditions over time, infants exposed in utero to buprenorphine exhibited fewer stress-abstinence signs (P < 0.001), were less excitable (P < 0.001) and less over-aroused (P < 0.01), exhibited less hypertonia (P < 0.007), had better self-regulation (P < 0.04) and required less handling (P < 0.001) to maintain a quiet alert state relative to in utero methadone-exposed infants. Infants who were older when they began morphine treatment for withdrawal had higher self-regulation scores (P < 0.01), and demonstrated the least amount of excitability (P < 0.02) and hypertonia (P < 0.02) on average. Quality of movement was correlated negatively with peak NAS score (P < 0.01), number of days treated with morphine for NAS (P < 0.01) and total amount of morphine received (P < 0.03). Excitability scores were related positively to total morphine dose (P < 0.03). CONCLUSION: While neurobehavior improves during the first month of postnatal life for in utero agonist medication-exposed neonates, buprenorphine exposure results in superior neurobehavioral scores and less severe withdrawal than does methadone exposure.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coyle MG ; Salisbury AL ; Lester BM ; Jones HE ; Lin H ; Graf-Rohrmeister K ; Fischer G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.04040.x ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects\r\nBuprenorphine/*adverse effects\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant Behavior/*drug effects\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nLinear Models\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*adverse effects\r\nMorphine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/drug therapy/*physiopathology\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/drug therapy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coyle MG, Salisbury AL, Lester BM, Jones HE, Lin H, Graf-Rohrmeister K, and Fischer G (2012) Neonatal neurobehavior effects following buprenorphine versus methadone exposure..

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of buprenorphine for relapse prevention among opioid dependent women in the CJ system transitioning back to the community. Methods: 36 women under CJ supervision were recruited from an inpatient drug treatment facility that treats CJ individuals returning back to the community. Nine were enrolled in an open label buprenorphine arm then 27 were randomized to buprenorphine (n= 15) or placebo (n= 12; double-blind). All women completed baseline measures and started study medication prior to release. Participants were followed weekly, provided urine drug screens (UDS), received study medication for 12 weeks, and returned for a 3-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed for all time points through 3 month follow-up. Results: The majority of participants were Caucasian (88.9%), young (M± SD = 31.8 ± 8.4 years), divorced/separated (59.2%) women with at least a high school/GED education (M± SD = 12 ± 1.7 years). GEE analyses showed that buprenorphine was efficacious in maintaining abstinence across time compared to placebo. At end of treatment, 92% of placebo and 33% of active medication participants were positive for opiates on urine drug screen (Chi-Square = 10.9, df = 1; p< 0.001). However, by the three month follow-up point, no differences were found between the two groups, with 83% of participants at follow-up positive for opiates. Conclusions: Women in the CJ system who received buprenorphine prior to release from a treatment facility had fewer opiate positive UDS through the 12 weeks of treatment compared to women receiving placebo. Initiating buprenorphine in a controlled environment prior to release appears to be a viable strategy to reduce opiate use when transitioning back to the community. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Comments":"2012-02-16","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cropsey K L; Lane P S; Hale G J; Jackson D O; Clark C B; Ingersoll K S; Islam M A; Stitzer M L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.06.021","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncriminal justice\r\ndrug dose titration\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug screening\r\neducational status\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhealth care facility\r\nhuman\r\nintention to treat analysis\r\nlegal aspect\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmarriage\r\nopiate addiction\r\npilot study\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\ntreatment duration\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cropsey K L, Lane P S, Hale G J, Jackson D O, Clark C B, Ingersoll K S, Islam M A, and Stitzer M L (2011) Results of a pilot randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine for opioid dependent women in the criminal justice system.

Aim: The study aimed to review the effectiveness of pharmacotherapies (Methadone (METH), Buprenorphine (BUP), levo-alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), Naltrexone (NLT) and Naloxone (NLX)) in reducing overdose deaths and increasing treatment retention in opioid dependent prisoners on release. Methods: A systematic review of studies on recently discharged opioid dependent prisoners receiving METH, BUP, LAAM, NLT and/or NLX was conducted. Factors of interest regarded post-release treatment retention, non-fatal overdoses (NFODs), overdose mortality, and continued heroin and/or other illicit drug use. Searches were conducted using MESH terms; opioid related disorder, prisoner, NLT, NLX, METH, BUP, LAAM, overdose. Exclusion criteria were applied as per PRISMA guidelines. Quality, outcome and risk of bias assessments were applied across studies. Results: Eight randomised control trials (RCT), one non-randomised trial and five observational studies formed the data set. Agonist Opioid Treatment (AOT) (METH, BUP, LAAM) initiated pre-release was associated with significant post-release treatment retention on discharge into the community, and post-release reduction in heroin use. Prisoners on BUP or METH on discharge had significantly reduced mortality risks in the immediate four weeks post-release. There was insufficient evidence supporting a reduction in NFODs and continued other illicit drug use. Conclusions: The review underscores the need for prisoners on AOT to be supported with continued treatment on release into the community. Further research is warranted to investigate potential utility of long-acting NLT formulations and take-home NLX (THN) in pre-release opioid dependant prisoners.","Comments":"2017-05-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Crowley D ; Van Hout M C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"benzodiazepine\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncocaine\r\nillicit drug\r\nlevacetylmethadol\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nplacebo\r\ntricyclic antidepressant agent\r\ncommunity integration\r\ndrug bioavailability\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug fatality\r\ndrug overdose\r\nheart arrhythmia\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhuman\r\nmortality risk\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprisoner\r\nQT prolongation\r\nreview\r\nrisk reduction\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Crowley D, and Van Hout M C (2017) Effectiveness of pharmacotherapies in increasing treatment retention and reducing opioid overdose death in individuals recently released from prison: A systematic review.

However, data to support this recommendation are sparse and conflicting, and the implications of this recommendation may include limiting the usefulness of buprenorphine treatment, as cocaine use is common among opioid-dependent individuals seeking buprenorphine treatment. We compared buprenorphine treatment outcomes (6-month treatment retention and self-reported opioid use over 6 months) in opioid-dependent cocaine users versus non-users who initiated buprenorphine treatment at an urban community health center. METHODS: We followed 87 participants over 6 months, collecting interview and medical record data. We used logistic regression models to test whether baseline cocaine use was associated with treatment retention and mixed effects nonlinear models to test whether baseline cocaine use was associated with self-reported opioid use. RESULTS: At baseline, 39.1% reported cocaine use. In all participants, self-reported opioid use decreased from 89.7% to 27.4% over 6 months, and 6-month treatment retention was 54.5%. We found no significant difference in 6-month treatment retention (AOR = 1.56, 95% CI: .58-4.17, p = .38) or self-reported opioid use (AOR = .89, 95% CI: .26-3.07, p = .85) between cocaine users and non-users. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that buprenorphine treatment retention is not worse in cocaine users than non-users, with clinically meaningful improvements in self-reported opioid use. These findings suggest that opioid-dependent cocaine users attain considerable benefits from office-based buprenorphine treatment and argue for the inclusion of these patients in office-based buprenorphine treatment programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cunningham CO ; Giovanniello A ; Kunins HV ; Roose RJ ; Fox AD ; Sohler NL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1521-0391.2013.12032.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nCocaine-Related Disorders/complications/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLongitudinal Studies\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/*psychology\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*psychology\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cunningham CO, Giovanniello A, Kunins HV, Roose RJ, Fox AD, and Sohler NL (2013) Buprenorphine treatment outcomes among opioid-dependent cocaine users and non-users..

Our previously published STOP (Suboxone Transition to Opiate Program) trial showed that buprenorphine induction, stabilization, and linkage to outpatient treatment in opioid-dependent inpatients (injection and non-injection drug users) decreased illicit opioid use over 6months. The present study was a planned subgroup analysis of injection opiate users from STOP. OBJECTIVE: To determine if inpatient buprenorphine initiation and linkage to outpatient buprenorphine reduce injection opiate users' frequency of injection opiate use (IOU). METHODS: Inpatient injection opiate users at a safety-net hospital were randomized to buprenorphine linkage (induction, stabilization, bridge prescription, and facilitated referral to outpatient treatment) or detoxification (5-day inpatient buprenorphine taper). Conditional fixed-effects Poisson regression was used to estimate the effects of intervention on 30-day (self-report) at 1, 3, and 6months, measured using 30-day timeline follow-back. The secondary outcome was linkage effectiveness, measured as % presenting to initial outpatient buprenorphine visits after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Analysis was limited to persons (n=62 randomized to detoxification and n=51 to linkage) with baseline IOU. There were no significant differences in age, ethnicity, or baseline IOU frequency. At follow-up, linkage patients (70.6%) were significantly more likely (p<0.001) to present to initial buprenorphine visits than detoxification patients (9.7%). However, there was no significant between group difference in the rate of IOU at 1- (IRR=0.73, p=0.32), 3- (IRR=1.20, p=0.54), or 6-month (IRR=0.73, p=0.23) follow-ups. Using person-day analysis, participants self-reported IOU on 5.8% of follow-up days in which they used prescription buprenorphine and 37.5% of non-buprenorphine days. Using a generalized estimating equation, the estimated odds of IOU was 4.57 times higher (p<0.001) on non-buprenorphine days. CONCLUSIONS: Despite STOP's success in linking patients who inject opiates to outpatient buprenorphine, the intervention did not significantly decrease their IOU frequency. Injection opiate users will require a more intensive protocol to sustain outpatient buprenorphine treatment and decrease injection with its attendant risks.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cushman PA ; Liebschutz JM ; Anderson BJ ; Moreau MR ; Stein MD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2016.06.003 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmbulatory Care/*methods\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHospitalization\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nPatient Transfer/organization & administration\r\nReferral and Consultation\r\nSafety-net Providers\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nHospitalization\r\nInjection drug use\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nTransitions of care","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cushman PA, Liebschutz JM, Anderson BJ, Moreau MR, and Stein MD (2016) Buprenorphine Initiation and Linkage to Outpatient Buprenorphine do not Reduce Frequency of Injection Opiate Use Following Hospitalization..

HRQOL was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) Acute Form. Participants remained blinded until 4 weeks after end of treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 201 participants received elbasvir/grazoprevir and 100 participants received placebo. Treatment difference mean change from baseline scores (elbasvir/grazoprevir minus placebo) indicated an improvement in HRQOL at 4 weeks after end of treatment in participants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir versus those receiving placebo, driven by declining HRQOL in those receiving placebo and improved HRQOL in certain domains among participants receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir. Notable differences in SF-36v2 scores were evident in the general health (mean treatment difference [MTD], 6.00; 95% CI, 1.37-10.63), vitality (MTD, 6.81; 95% CI, 1.88-11.75), and mental health (MTD, 5.17; 95% CI, 0.52-9.82) domains and in the mental component summary score (mean, 2.83; 95% CI, 0.29-5.37). No notable between-treatment differences were evident at treatment weeks 4 or 12. CONCLUSION: HRQOL in patients receiving medication for opioid dependence was improved following treatment for HCV infection with elbasvir/grazoprevir, suggesting that eradication of HCV infection with direct-acting antivirals is associated with improved HRQOL.

Buprenorphine and methadone are the two most commonly recommended pharmacotherapies. Individuals who remain in treatment longer tend to have a reduced drug use, a higher social functioning, and a higher quality of life. The addition of naloxone to buprenorphine (bup/nx) was developed, in part, to help increase retention in treatment. However, this has not been shown in research. The objective of this review was to examine whether bup/nx is more effective than buprenorphine and methadone, to ultimately determine whether the addition of naloxone shows a clinical difference. METHODS: The literature search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. Search strategies were thoroughly developed and modified for each database by combining relevant MeSH and Emtree terms as well as keywords such as \"bup/nx,\" \"buprenorphine,\" and \"naloxone.\" The outcome measure was treatment retention, as determined by the number of days a participant remains in a treatment program. RESULTS: There were four studies included in the review. The data were analyzed with Review Manager software. There was no statistically significant result for bup/nx compared with methadone or buprenorphine. CONCLUSION: Bup/nx may be an alternative to standard treatments such as buprenorphine and methadone as the addition of naloxone does not affect retention in treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dalton K ; Butt N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JAN.0000000000000308 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/nursing\r\n*Patient Compliance\r\nQuality of Life\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dalton K, and Butt N (2019) Does the Addition of Naloxone in Buprenorphine/Naloxone Affect Retention in Treatment in Opioid Replacement Therapy?: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis..

However, recruitment into the study stopped when it became apparent that attendance at counselling sessions was poor. Aims: The aim of the current study was to determine the reasons for both non-attendance and attendance from a patient's perspective at counselling sessions. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed whereby participants who were recruited for the original study were interviewed utilising a semi-structured interview format. Results: Motivational inconsistencies were most frequently cited as the reason for dropping out of counselling, whereas a good relationship with staff was cited by attenders as the most important factors which aided their attendance at counselling sessions. Conclusions: Selecting opiate-dependent methadone-maintained cocaine abusers on the basis of their urine toxicology and offering them counselling as a way of reducing their harmful drug use did not prove efficacious. Attempting to address cocaine misuse within this cohort may need a more stepped approach including brief interventions, such as motivational interviewing, or other enhancers of motivation before we can test the effectiveness of CBCS in this population. © 2012 Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.","Comments":"2019-05-31","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Darker C ; Sweeney B ; El Hassan H ; Kelly A ; Connor S ; Smyth B ; Barry J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11845-011-0803-4","Keywords":"cocaine\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncocaine dependence\r\ncognitive therapy\r\ncohort analysis\r\ncoping\r\ndrug misuse\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nhuman relation\r\nmale\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmotivation\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient counseling\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nstaff","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Darker C, Sweeney B, El Hassan H, Kelly A, Connor S, Smyth B, and Barry J (2012) Non-attendance at counselling therapy in cocaine-using methadone-maintained patients: Lessons learnt from an abandoned randomised controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of methadone and morphine in NAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized, double-blind, intention-to-treat trial, term infants from 8 US newborn units whose mothers received buprenorphine, methadone, or opioids for pain control during pregnancy were eligible. A total of 117 infants were randomized to receive methadone or morphine from February 9, 2014, to March 6, 2017. Mothers who declined randomization could consent to data collection and standard institutional treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were assessed with the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System every 4 hours and treated with methadone or placebo every 4 hours or morphine every 4 hours. Infants with persistently elevated Finnegan scores received dose increases. Infants who exceeded a predetermined opioid dose received phenobarbital. Dose reductions occurred every 12 to 48 hours when signs of NAS were controlled with therapy, stopping at 20% of the original dose. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was length of hospital stay (LOS). The secondary end points were LOS attributable to NAS and length of drug treatment (LOT). RESULTS: A total of 183 mothers consented to have their infants in the study; 117 infants required treatment. Because 1 parent withdrew consent, data were analyzed on 116 infants (mean [SD] gestational age, 39.1 [1.1] weeks; mean [SD] birth weight, 3157 [486] g; 58 [50%] male). Demographic variables and risk factors were similar except for more prenatal cigarette exposure in infants who received methadone. Adjusting for study site and maternal opioid type, methadone was associated with decreased mean number of days for LOS by 14% (relative number of days, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00; P = .046), corresponding to a difference of 2.9 days; 14% reduction in LOS attributable to NAS (relative number of days, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96; P = .01), corresponding to a difference of 2.7 days; and 16% reduction in LOT (relative number of days, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97; P = .02), corresponding to a difference of 2.3 days. Methadone was also associated with reduced median LOS (16 vs 20 days, P = .005), LOS attributable to NAS (16 vs 19 days, P = .005), and LOT (11.5 vs 15 days, P = .009). Study infants had better short-term outcomes than 170 nonrandomized infants treated with morphine per standard institutional protocols. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: With use of weight- and sign-based treatment for NAS, short-term outcomes were better in infants receiving methadone compared with morphine. Assessment of longer-term outcomes is ongoing.

However, although individual studies demonstrate benefit for structured psychosocial interventions, meta-analytical reviews find no benefit for manual-based treatments beyond 'routine counselling'. ANALYSIS: We consider the question of whether OST medication alone is sufficient to produce the required outcomes, or whether greater efforts should be made to provide high-quality psychosocial treatment alongside medication. In so doing, we consider the nuances and limitations of the evidence and the organizational barriers to transferring it into routine practice. CONCLUSION: The evidence base for psychosocial interventions in opiate substitution treatment (OST) services can be interpreted both positively and negatively. Steering a path between overly optimistic or nihilistic interpretations of the value of psychosocial treatment in OST programmes is the most pragmatic approach. Greater attention should be paid to elements common to all psychological treatments (such as therapeutic alliance), but also to the sequencing and packaging of psychosocial elements and their linkage to peer-led interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Day E ; Mitcheson L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13644 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods/*psychology\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*psychology/*therapy\r\n*Psychosocial Support Systems\r\nEvidence-based practice\r\nopiate\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npsychosocial intervention\r\ntraining\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Day E, and Mitcheson L (2017) Psychosocial interventions in opiate substitution treatment services: does the evidence provide a case for optimism or nihilism?.

Despite emerging evidence supporting the negative impact of ongoing pain in the treatment of OUD, the pharmacological management of pain in the presence of OUD has received limited attention. We sought to systematically review the studies investigating pharmacotherapies for pain among persons with OUD. Eligible studies had participants with OUD and outcomes including evoked or spontaneous pain. We searched Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, and Embase. Out of 1,097 studies that met the search criteria, 12 studies provided data relevant to the research question—five laboratory studies and seven clinical trials. Random effects pooled estimates suggested no significant difference between groups at baseline but a response favoring the active treatment group over placebo, with nonsignificant heterogeneity between studies. Findings from these studies provide preliminary evidence for analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of gabapentin, GABA agonists, and NMDA antagonists among persons with OUD. To establish the tradeoffs between the analgesic effects and abuse liability of these compounds, further well-controlled clinical trials are required among persons with OUD. This review also underscores the need for methodological enhancement in drug development for pain in OUD. Future research should address the clinical and neurobiological overlap between pain- and addiction-related phenomena. Transdisciplinary approaches may identify biomarkers of these shared phenomena and their neural substrates. The development of novel therapeutics for pain in OUD may be accelerated by such integration of pain and addiction research.","Comments":"2020-09-29","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Aquino J P; Flores J M; Avila-Quintero V J; Compton P ; Sofuoglu M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/adb.12964","Keywords":"4 aminobutyric acid receptor stimulating agent\r\nalpha 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent\r\nanalgesic agent\r\nbiological marker\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ncannabinoid\r\ncholecystokinin receptor blocking agent\r\ndextromethorphan\r\ngabapentin\r\nglial activation inhibitor\r\nketamine\r\nmethadone\r\nmidazolam\r\nminocycline\r\nn methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate antagonist\r\nplacebo\r\nunclassified drug\r\nadverse event\r\nanalgesic activity\r\narticle\r\ncentral nervous system\r\ncholinergic system\r\nchronic pain\r\nclinical feature\r\ndisease association\r\ndrug response\r\ndrug targeting\r\nhuman\r\nmeta analysis\r\nneurobiology\r\nnociception\r\nnonhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npain\r\npain assessment\r\nreward\r\nsensitization\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Aquino J P, Flores J M, Avila-Quintero V J, Compton P, and Sofuoglu M (2021) Pharmacological treatment of pain among persons with opioid addiction: A systematic review and meta-analysis with implications for drug development.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of experimental pain studies examining opioid-induced analgesia among persons with OUD on OAT. We searched multiple databases from inception to July 30, 2021. Study quality was assessed by previously established validity measures. RESULTS: Nine studies were identified, with a total of 225 participants, of whom 63% were male, and 37% were female. Six studies included methadone-maintained persons with OUD; four studies included buprenorphine-maintained persons with OUD; and three studies included healthy persons as comparison groups. Either additional doses of OAT or other opioids - morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, or remifentanil - were administered. In seven studies, persons with OUD on OAT did not experience analgesia, despite receiving opioid doses up to 20 times greater than those clinically used to treat severe pain among the opioid naïve. Conversely, in two studies, high-potency opioids did produce analgesia, albeit with greater abuse potential. Notably, persons with OUD on OAT remained vulnerable to respiratory depression. CONCLUSIONS: Although persons with OUD on OAT can derive analgesic effects from opioids, high-potency compounds may be required to achieve clinically significant pain relief. Further, persons with OUD on OAT may remain vulnerable to opioid-induced abuse potential and respiratory depression.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies examining the association between opioid withdrawal and cannabis use or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration. We searched multiple databases from inception to July 30, 2022, and assessed study quality. Results: Eleven studies were identified, with a total of 5330 participants, of whom 64 % were male. Nine observational studies examined the association between cannabis use and opioid withdrawal. Two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) investigated the withdrawal-alleviating effects of dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC. Four observational studies found an association between cannabis use and the alleviation of opioid withdrawal; one reported exacerbation of opioid withdrawal symptoms; and four reported no association. RCTs reported that THC alleviated opioid withdrawal, albeit with dose-dependent increases in measures of abuse liability, dysphoria, and tachycardia. There was high heterogeneity in measurements of opioid withdrawal and the type and dose of opioid at baseline. Conclusions: Although there is preliminary evidence that cannabis and its main psychoactive constituent, THC, may alleviate opioid withdrawal, these effects are likely to have a narrow therapeutic window. Further, the potential of cannabinoids to alleviate opioid withdrawal is determined by complex interactions between patient characteristics and pharmacological factors. Collectively, these findings have clinical, methodological, and mechanistic implications for treating opioid withdrawal during cannabinoid use, and for efforts to alleviate opioid withdrawal using non-opioid therapeutics.","Comments":"2022-12-07","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Aquino J P; Bahji A ; Gómez O ; Sofuoglu M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109702","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ncannabis\r\nclonazepam\r\nclonidine\r\ndronabinol\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\noxycodone\r\nplacebo\r\nzolpidem\r\ncannabis use\r\ndisease exacerbation\r\ndose response\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\ndysphoria\r\nhuman\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nside effect\r\nsystematic review\r\ntachycardia\r\ntherapeutic index\r\nvisual analog scale\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Aquino J P, Bahji A, Gómez O, and Sofuoglu M (2022) Alleviation of opioid withdrawal by cannabis and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol: A systematic review of observational and experimental human studies.

Preclinical studies have reported that cannabinoid and opioid agonists produce synergistic antinociceptive effects. Still, there are no experimental data on the effects of cannabinoid agonists among humans who receive opioid agonist therapies for opioid use disorder (OUD). We conducted an experimental study to investigate the acute effects of the delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) among persons receiving methadone therapy for OUD. Using a within-subject, crossover, human laboratory design, 25 persons on methadone therapy for OUD (24% women) were randomly assigned to receive single oral doses of THC (10 or 20 mg, administered as dronabinol) or placebo, during three separate 5-h test sessions. Measures of experimental and self-reported pain sensitivity, abuse potential, cognitive performance and physiological effects were collected. Mixed-effects models examined the main effects of THC dose and interactions between THC (10 and 20 mg) and methadone doses (low-dose methadone defined as <90 mg/day; high dose defined as >90 mg/day). Results demonstrated that, for self-reported rather than experimental pain sensitivity measures, 10 mg THC provided greater relief than 20 mg THC, with no substantial evidence of abuse potential, and inconsistent dose-dependent cognitive adverse effects. There was no indication of any interaction between THC and methadone doses. Collectively, these results provide valuable insights for future studies aiming to evaluate the risk–benefit profile of cannabinoids to relieve pain among individuals receiving opioid agonist therapy for OUD, a timely endeavour amidst the opioid crisis.","Comments":"2023-09-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"De Aquino J P; Meyerovich J ; Xie C Z; Ranganathan M ; Compton P ; Pittman B ; Rogan M ; Sofuoglu M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/adb.13317","Keywords":"alcohol\r\ncannabis\r\ncocaine\r\ndronabinol\r\nmethadone\r\nplacebo\r\nsedative agent\r\nadult\r\naged\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical laboratory\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndose response\r\ndrug dose comparison\r\ndrug effect\r\nexperimental study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmale\r\nmental performance\r\nmixed effects model\r\nneuromodulation\r\nnociception\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrisk benefit analysis\r\nself report\r\nsingle drug dose\r\nstatistical model\r\ntobacco","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Aquino J P, Meyerovich J, Xie C Z, Ranganathan M, Compton P, Pittman B, Rogan M, and Sofuoglu M (2023) Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol modulates pain sensitivity among persons receiving opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder: A within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled laboratory study.

An injectable suspension of naltrexone for extended release (XR-NTX) was recently approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid dependence. XR-NTX treatment may require concurrent behavioral intervention to maximize adherence and effectiveness, thus we sought to evaluate employment-based reinforcement as a method of improving adherence to XR-NTX in opiate dependent adults. Methods: Opioid-dependent adults (n = 38) were detoxified and inducted onto oral naltrexone, then randomly assigned to contingency or prescription conditions. Participants received up to six doses of XR-NTX at four-week intervals. All participants could earn vouchers for attendance and performance at a therapeutic workplace. Contingency participants were required to accept XR-NTX injections to access the workplace and earn vouchers. Prescription participants could earn vouchers independent of their acceptance of XR-NTX injections. Results: Contingency participants accepted significantly more naltrexone injections than prescription participants (87% versus 52%, p= .002), and were more likely to accept all injections (74% versus 26%, p= .004). Participants in the two conditions provided similar percentages of samples negative for opiates (72% versus 65%) and for cocaine (58% versus 54%). Opiate positivity was significantly more likely when samples were also cocaine positive, independent of naltrexone blockade (p= .002). Conclusions: Long-term adherence to XR-NTX in unemployed opiate dependent adults is low under usual care conditions. Employment-based reinforcement can maintain adherence to XR-NTX. Ongoing cocaine use appears to interfere with the clinical effectiveness of XR-NTX on opiate use. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Comments":"2012-02-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"DeFulio A ; Everly J J; Leoutsakos J M.S; Umbricht A ; Fingerhood M ; Bigelow G E; Silverman K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.06.023","Keywords":"NCT00684788\r\ncocaine\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled release formulation\r\ncontrolled study\r\nemployment\r\nextended release formulation\r\nfemale\r\nFood and Drug Administration\r\nhealth behavior\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\nprescription\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nreinforcement (psychology)\r\nworkplace","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"DeFulio A, Everly J J, Leoutsakos J M.S, Umbricht A, Fingerhood M, Bigelow G E, and Silverman K (2012) Employment-based reinforcement of adherence to an FDA approved extended release formulation of naltrexone in opioid-dependent adults: A randomized controlled trial.

Methadone and buprenorphine are common medications provided as OAT. We aimed to examine buprenorphine compared with methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence across a wide range of primary and secondary outcomes. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with GATHER and PRISMA guidelines. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO from database inception to Aug 1, 2022; clinical trial registries and previous relevant Cochrane reviews were also reviewed. We included all RCTs and observational studies of adults (aged ≥18 years) with opioid dependence comparing treatment with buprenorphine or methadone. Primary outcomes were retention in treatment at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, treatment adherence (measured through doses taken as prescribed, dosing visits attended, and biological measures), or extra-medical opioid use (measured by urinalysis and self-report). Secondary outcomes were use of benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, and alcohol; withdrawal; craving; criminal activity and engagement with the criminal justice system; overdose; mental and physical health; sleep; pain; global functioning; suicidality and self-harm; and adverse events. Single-arm cohort studies and RCTs that collected data on buprenorphine retention alone were also reviewed. Data on study, participant, and treatment characteristics were extracted. Study authors were contacted to obtain additional data when required. Comparative estimates were pooled with use of random-effects meta-analyses. The proportion of individuals retained in treatment across multiple timepoints was pooled for each drug. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020205109). Findings: We identified 32 eligible RCTs (N=5808 participants) and 69 observational studies (N=323 340) comparing buprenorphine and methadone, in addition to 51 RCTs (N=11 644) and 124 observational studies (N=700 035) that reported on treatment retention with buprenorphine. Overall, 61 studies were done in western Europe, 162 in North America, 14 in north Africa and the Middle East, 20 in Australasia, five in southeast Asia, seven in south Asia, two in eastern Europe, three in central Europe, one in east Asia, and one in central Asia. 1 040 827 participants were included in these primary studies; however, gender was only reported for 572 111 participants, of whom 377 991 (66·1%) were male and 194 120 (33·9%) were female. Mean age was 37·1 years (SD 6·0). At timepoints beyond 1 month, retention was better for methadone than for buprenorphine: for example, at 6 months, the pooled effect favoured methadone in RCTs (risk ratio 0·76 [95% CI 0·67–0·85]; I·=74·2%; 16 studies, N=3151) and in observational studies (0·77 [0·68–0·86]; I·=98·5%; 21 studies, N=155 111). Retention was generally higher in RCTs than observational studies. There was no evidence suggesting that adherence to treatment differed with buprenorphine compared with methadone. There was some evidence that extra-medical opioid use was lower in those receiving buprenorphine in RCTs that measured this outcome by urinalysis and reported proportion of positive urine samples (over various time frames; standardised mean difference –0·20 [–0·29 to –0·11]; I·=0·0%; three studies, N=841), but no differences were found when using other measures. Some statistically significant differences were found between buprenorphine and methadone among secondary outcomes. There was evidence of reduced cocaine use, cravings, anxiety, and cardiac dysfunction, as well as increased treatment satisfaction among people receiving buprenorphine compared with methadone; and evidence of reduced hospitalisation and alcohol use in people receiving methadone. These differences in secondary outcomes were based on small numbers of studies (maximum five), and were often not consistent across study types or different measures of the same constructs (eg, cocaine use). Interpretation: Evidence from trials and observational studies suggest that treatment retention is better for methadone than for sublingual buprenorphine. Comparative evidence on other outcomes examined showed few statistically significant differences and was generally based on small numbers of studies.

Expert opinion: Pharmacotherapy is recommended as part of an integrated OUD treatment approach with psychosocial interventions, with the goal of reducing risks of illicit opioid use, overdose mortality, infection with HIV or HCV, improving health, psychological and social outcomes. Access to OAT should be prioritised in the treatment of OUD. Treatment choices in OUD pharmacotherapy should be based on the needs of the individual and characteristics of medications. Recommendations for choices of OAT are based on clinical efficacy, safety, patient preference, side effects, pharmacological interactions, quality of life, dose titration potential and outcomes (control craving, ongoing opioids consumption or other drugs, and potentially psychiatric comorbidities). Special groups, pregnant women, prisoners, patients with mental health problems have specific needs which must be addressed with expert input.","Comments":"2017-12-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dematteis M ; Auriacombe M ; D’Agnone O ; Somaini L ; Szerman N ; Littlewood R ; Alam F ; Alho H ; Benyamina A ; Bobes J ; Daulouede J P; Leonardi C ; Maremmani I ; Torrens M ; Walcher S ; Soyka M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/14656566.2017.1409722","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nalcoholism\r\nclinical decision making\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug cross tolerance\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug intoxication\r\ndrug metabolism\r\ndrug safety\r\nhuman\r\nmortality\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain\r\npatient preference\r\npharmaceutical care\r\npractice guideline\r\npregnant woman\r\nprisoner\r\nquality of life\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dematteis M, Auriacombe M, D’Agnone O, Somaini L, Szerman N, Littlewood R, Alam F, Alho H, Benyamina A, Bobes J, Daulouede J P, Leonardi C, Maremmani I, Torrens M, Walcher S, and Soyka M (2017) Recommendations for buprenorphine and methadone therapy in opioid use disorder: a European consensus.

Due to their addictive potential, effort and vigilance in controlling prescriptions is needed to avoid misuse and dependence. Despite the effort, the prevalence of opioid use disorder continues to rise.

This is important when evaluating opioid substitution and antagonist therapies (OSATs), especially given the challenges associated with treating the opioid-dependent population. We aimed to identify OSAT trials' eligibility criteria, quantify the percentage of the clinical population excluded by these criteria, and determine how OSAT guidelines incorporate evidence from these trials. Methods: We performed a systematic review to identify the eligibility criteria used across trials. We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (CTR), World Health Organization International CTR Platform Search Portal, and the National Institutes of Health CTR databases from inception to January 1, 2014. To quantify the effect of trials' eligibility criteria on generalizability, we applied these criteria to data from an observational study of opioid-dependent patients (n = 394). We then accessed the Canadian, American, British, and World Health Organization (WHO) OSAT guidelines to evaluate how evidence is used in the recommendations. Results: Among the 60 trials identified the majority (≥50 % of trials) exclude patients with psychiatric (60 %) and physical comorbidity (51.7 %). Additionally, we found 19 trials exclude patients with current alcohol/substance-use problems (31.7 %), and 29 (48.3 %) exclude patients taking psychotropic medications. These criteria were restrictive and in some cases rendered 70 % of the observational sample ineligible. North American OSAT guidelines made strong recommendations supported by evidence with poor generalizability. National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and WHO guidelines for opioid misuse provide a critical assessment of the literature used to inform their recommendations. Conclusions: Trials assessing OSATs often exclude patients with concurrent disorders. If the excluded patients respond differently to treatment, results from these trials are likely to overestimate the true effectiveness of OSATs. North American guidelines should consider these limitations when drafting clinical recommendations.","Comments":"2015-11-03","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dennis B B; Roshanov P S; Naji L ; Bawor M ; Paul J ; Plater C ; Pare G ; Worster A ; Varenbut M ; Daiter J ; Marsh D C; Desai D ; Samaan Z ; Thabane L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13063-015-0942-4","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\npsychotropic agent\r\nalcohol abuse\r\narticle\r\nclinical assessment\r\ncohort analysis\r\ncomorbidity\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmeta analysis\r\nobservational study\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprevalence\r\nprospective study\r\npsychological well-being\r\nsubstance abuse\r\nsystematic review\r\nWorld Health Organization","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dennis B B, Roshanov P S, Naji L, Bawor M, Paul J, Plater C, Pare G, Worster A, Varenbut M, Daiter J, Marsh D C, Desai D, Samaan Z, and Thabane L (2015) Opioid substitution and antagonist therapy trials exclude the common addiction patient: A systematic review and analysis of eligibility criteria.

Chronic pain is a major risk factor for opioid relapse within the addiction treatment setting. There exist a number of opioid maintenance therapies including methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, and levomethadyl acetate (LAAM), of which the mediating effects of pain on treatment attrition, substance use behavior, and social functioning may differ across therapies. We aim to 1) evaluate the impact of pain on the treatment outcomes of addiction patients being managed with OST and 2) identify the most recently published opioid maintenance treatment guidelines from the United States, Canada, and the UK to determine how the evidence is being translated into clinical practice. Methods/design: The authors will search Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ProQuest Dissertations and theses Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and the National Institutes for Health Clinical Trials Registry. We will search www.guidelines.gov and the National Institute for Care and Excellence (NICE) databases to identify the most recently published OST guidelines. All screening and data extraction will be completed in duplicate. Provided the data are suitable, we will perform a multiple treatment comparison using Bayesian meta-analytic methods to produce summary statistics estimating the effect of chronic pain on all OSTs. Our primary outcome is substance use behavior, which includes opioid and non-opioid substance use. We will also evaluate secondary endpoints such as treatment retention, general physical health, intervention adherence, personal and social functioning, as well as psychiatric symptoms. Discussion: This review will capture the experience of treatment outcomes for a sub-population of opioid addiction patients and provide an opportunity to distinguish the best quality guidelines for OST. If chronic pain truly does result in negative consequences for opioid addiction patients, it is important we identify which OSTs are most appropriate for chronic pain patients as well as ensure the treatment guidelines incorporate this information.

METHODS: We searched the Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, ProQuest Dissertations and theses Database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal, and National Institutes for Health Clinical Trials Registry databases to identify articles evaluating the impact of pain on addiction treatment outcomes for patients maintained on opioid agonist therapy. RESULTS: Upon screening 3,540 articles, 14 studies with a combined sample of 3,128 patients fulfilled the review inclusion criteria. Results from the meta-analysis suggest that pain has no effect on illicit opioid consumption [pooled odds ratio (pOR): 0.70, 95%CI 0.41-1.17; I (2) = 0.0] but a protective effect for reducing illicit non-opioid substance use (pOR: 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.79; I (2) = 0.0). Studies evaluating illicit opioid consumption using other measures demonstrate pain to increase the risk for opioid abuse. Pain is significantly associated with the presence of psychiatric disorders (pOR: 2.18; 95%CI 1.6, 2.9; I (2) = 0.0%). CONCLUSION: CNCP may increase risk for continued opioid abuse and poor psychiatric functioning. Qualitative synthesis of the findings suggests that major methodological differences in the design and measurement of pain and treatment response outcomes are likely impacting the effect estimates.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dennis BB ; Bawor M ; Naji L ; Chan CK ; Varenbut J ; Paul J ; Varenbut M ; Daiter J ; Plater C ; Pare G ; Marsh DC ; Worster A ; Desai D ; Thabane L ; Samaan Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4137/SART.S30120 ","Keywords":"chronic pain\r\nguidelines\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nopioid substitution therapy\r\nopioid use disorder\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dennis BB, Bawor M, Naji L, Chan CK, Varenbut J, Paul J, Varenbut M, Daiter J, Plater C, Pare G, Marsh DC, Worster A, Desai D, Thabane L, and Samaan Z (2015) Impact of Chronic Pain on Treatment Prognosis for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis..

These discrepancies may be a direct result of variations in the measurement of chronic pain or definitions of response to methadone treatment. The goal of this study is to evaluate the association between pain and substance use behaviour to determine the real impact of comorbid pain in the methadone population. We also aim to examine sources of variation across the literature with a specific focus on the measurement of pain. Methods/Design: We performed a systematic review using an electronic search strategy across CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsychINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library including Cochrane Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. Title, abstract, as well as full text screening and extraction were performed in duplicate. Studies evaluating the association between chronic pain and methadone maintenance treatment response were eligible for inclusion in this review. Using a sample of 297 methadone patients from the Genetics of Opioid Addiction (GENOA) research collaborative, we assessed the reliability of patient self-reported pain and the validated Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assessment tool. Results: After screening 826 articles we identified five studies eligible for full text extraction, of which three showed a significant relationship between the presence of pain and the increase in substance abuse among patients on methadone for the treatment of opioid dependence. Studies varied largely in the definitions and measurement of both pain and response to treatment. Results from our validation of pain measurement in the GENOA sample (n=297) showed the use of a simple self-reported pain question is highly correlated to the use of the BPI. Simply asking patients whether they have pain showed a 44.2% sensitivity, 88.8% specificity, 84.4% PPV and 53.6% NPV to the BPI. The area under the ROC curve was 0.67 and the Pearson χ2 was 37.3; (p<0.0001). Discussion: The field of addiction medicine is at a lack of consensus as to the real effect of chronic pain on treatment response among opioid dependent patients. Whether it be the lack of a single “gold standard” measurement of response, or a lack of consistent measurement of pain, it is difficult to summarize and compare the results of these relatively small investigations. In comparison to the BPI, use of the simple self-reported pain has lower sensitivity for identifying patients with pain, suggesting the inconsistencies in these studies may result from differences in pain measurement. Future validation studies of pain measurement are required to address the predictive value of self-reported pain.","Comments":"2016-04-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dennis B B; Bawor M ; Paul J ; Plater C ; Pare G ; Worster A ; Varenbut M ; Daiter J ; Marsh D C; Desai D ; Thabane L ; Samaan Z ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/187447370901160321102837","Keywords":"article\r\nBrief Pain Inventory\r\nchronic pain\r\ncomorbidity\r\ndiagnostic value\r\nhuman\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\nprescription\r\npriority journal\r\nprognostic value\r\nquality control\r\nquestionnaire\r\nreceiver operating characteristic\r\nsensitivity and specificity\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment response\r\nvalidation process","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dennis B B, Bawor M, Paul J, Plater C, Pare G, Worster A, Varenbut M, Daiter J, Marsh D C, Desai D, Thabane L, and Samaan Z (2016) Pain and opioid addiction: A systematic review and evaluation of pain measurement in patients with opioid dependence on methadone maintenance Treatment.

We sought to describe the variation in current outcomes employed across clinical trials for opioid addiction, as well as determine whether a discrepancy exists between the treatment targets that patients consider important and how treatment effectiveness is measured in the literature. Methods: We searched nine commonly used databases (e.g., EMBASE, MEDLINE) from inception to August 1, 2015. Outcomes used across trials were extracted and categorized according to previously established domains. To evaluate patient-reported goals of treatment, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 adults undergoing methadone treatment. Results: We identified 60 trials eligible for inclusion. Once outcomes were categorized into eight broad domains (e.g., abstinence/substance abuse), we identified 21 specific outcomes with furthermore 53 subdomains and 118 measurements. Continued opioid use and treatment retention were the most commonly reported measures (46%, n = 28). The majority of patients agreed that abstinence from opioids was a primary goal in their treatment, although they also stressed goals under-reported in clinical trials. Conclusions: There is inconsistency in the measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of OSATs. Individual and population level decision making is being guided by a standard of effect considered useful to researchers yet in direct conflict with what patients deem important.

DATA SOURCES: We searched 11 databases using the following key terms: breastfeeding, barriers, facilitators, promotion, and opioid. STUDY SELECTION: We included articles published in English since 2015 that addressed barriers and facilitators of breastfeeding in women on OMT. We did not limit our search to specific types of studies. Our search produced 65 records. After reviewing titles and abstracts, we assessed 21 full-text articles and excluded seven for lack of data related to our key terms. As a result, we included five qualitative studies, three reviews, three mixed-methods studies, two retrospective cohort studies, and one case report (14 articles) in our final review. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted data from each article and sorted them in a table for analysis and synthesis. Data included study purpose, research questions, design and methodology, and findings specifically pertaining to the identification of barriers and facilitators of breastfeeding for women on OMT. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified three themes related to facilitators of and barriers to breastfeeding: Information, Support, and Health Care System Factors. CONCLUSION: The results of our review suggest that most barriers and facilitators of breastfeeding in women on OMT are manageable with improved health care practices. Primary and acute care health professionals should modify practices to minimize barriers to breastfeeding. Nurses should provide better breastfeeding education and preparation, sensitive care in the immediate postpartum period, and extended follow-up after hospital discharge for women on OMT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Doerzbacher M ; Sperlich M ; Hequembourg A ; Chang YP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jogn.2021.09.004 ","Keywords":"*Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Breast Feeding\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nPostpartum Period\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nbreastfeeding\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nopioid maintenance therapy\r\nopioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Doerzbacher M, Sperlich M, Hequembourg A, and Chang YP (2022) Scoping Review of Barriers and Facilitators of Breastfeeding in Women on Opioid Maintenance Therapy..

Evidence of long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic pain is limited. Opioid use is associated with serious risks, including opioid use disorder and overdose. OBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. PROCESS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated a 2014 systematic review on effectiveness and risks of opioids and conducted a supplemental review on benefits and harms, values and preferences, and costs. CDC used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess evidence type and determine the recommendation category. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Evidence consisted of observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations, characterized as low quality using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies, variability in study designs and clinical heterogeneity, and methodological shortcomings of studies. No study evaluated long-term (≥1 year) benefit of opioids for chronic pain. Opioids were associated with increased risks, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death, with dose-dependent effects. RECOMMENDATIONS: There are 12 recommendations. Of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for treatment of chronic pain. Opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before starting opioids, clinicians should establish treatment goals with patients and consider how opioids will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are used, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage, carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, and avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued opioid therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently and review prescription drug monitoring program data, when available, for high-risk combinations or dosages. For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The guideline is intended to improve communication about benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, improve safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dowell D ; Haegerich TM ; Chou R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2016.1464 ","Keywords":"Acute Pain/drug therapy\r\nAdult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nBenzodiazepines/therapeutic use\r\n*Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.\r\nChronic Pain/*drug therapy\r\nCommunication\r\nContraindications\r\nDrug Prescriptions/*standards\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nGoals\r\nHumans\r\nObservational Studies as Topic\r\nPrescription Drug Misuse/prevention & control\r\nPrimary Health Care/standards\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States\r\nWithholding Treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dowell D, Haegerich TM, and Chou R (2016) CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain--United States, 2016..

Supervised withdrawal (ie, detoxification) from opioids using clonidine or buprenorphine hydrochloride is a widely used treatment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether tramadol hydrochloride extended-release (ER), an approved analgesic with opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action and low abuse potential, is effective for use in supervised withdrawal settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in a residential research setting with 103 participants with OUD. Participants' treatment was stabilized with morphine, 30 mg, administered subcutaneously 4 times daily. A 7-day taper using clonidine (n = 36), tramadol ER (n = 36), or buprenorphine (n = 31) was then instituted, and patients were crossed-over to double-blind placebo during a post-taper period. The study was conducted from October 25, 2010, to June 23, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Retention, withdrawal symptom management, concomitant medication utilization, and naltrexone induction. Results were analyzed over time and using area under the curve for the intention-to-treat and completer groups. RESULTS: Of the 103 participants, 88 (85.4%) were men and 43 (41.7%) were white; mean (SD) age was 28.9 (10.4) years. Buprenorphine participants (28 [90.3%]) were significantly more likely to be retained at the end of the taper compared with clonidine participants (22 [61.1%]); tramadol ER retention was intermediate and did not differ significantly from that of the other groups (26 [72.2%]; χ2 = 8.5, P = .01). Time-course analyses of withdrawal revealed significant effects of phase (taper, post taper) for the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score (taper mean, 5.19 [SE, .26]; post-taper mean, 3.97 [SE, .23]; F2,170 = 3.6, P = .03) and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) score (taper mean,8.81 [SE, .40]; post-taper mean, 4.14 [SE, .30]; F2,170 = 15.7, P < .001), but no group effects or group × phase interactions. Analyses of area under the curve of SOWS total scores showed significant reductions (F2,159 = 17.7, P < .001) in withdrawal severity between the taper and post-taper periods for clonidine (taper mean, 13.1; post-taper mean, 3.2; P < .001) and tramadol ER (taper mean, 7.4; post-taper mean, 2.8; P = .03), but not buprenorphine (taper mean, 6.4; post-taper mean, 7.4). Use of concomitant medication increased significantly (F2,159 = 30.7, P < .001) from stabilization to taper in the clonidine (stabilization mean, 0.64 [SE, .05]; taper mean, 1.54 [SE, .10]; P < .001) and tramadol ER (stabilization mean, 0.53 [SE, .05]; taper mean, 1.19 [SE, .09]; P = .003) groups and from stabilization to post taper in the buprenorphine group (stabilization mean, 0.46 [SE, .05] post-taper mean, 1.17 [SE, .09]; P = .006), suggesting higher withdrawal for those groups during those periods. Naltrexone initiation was voluntary and the percentage of participants choosing naltrexone therapy within the clonidine (8 [22.2%]), tramadol ER (7 [19.4%]), or buprenorphine (3 [9.7%]) groups did not differ significantly (χ2 = 2.5, P = .29). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this trial suggest that tramadol ER is more effective than clonidine and comparable to buprenorphine in reducing opioid withdrawal symptoms during a residential tapering program. Data support further examination of tramadol ER as a method to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.

METHODS: This study evaluated the MedMinder \"Jon\", an electronic and cellular-enabled pillbox that provides real-time monitoring to remotely manage take-home doses of methadone using a 12-week, within-subject, Phase II (NCT03254043) trial. We transitioned all participants from liquid to tablet methadone one week prior to randomization. Participants completed both treatment-as-usual and electronic pillbox conditions before choosing a condition in a final \"choice phase\". We assessed feasibility, satisfaction, and safety outcomes during the exit interview. RESULTS: Overall, we randomized 25 participants, 24 (96.0%) completed >1 study session, and 21 (84.0%) completed the exit interview. We dispensed 167.92 g (1,974 doses) of methadone. Participants would use the pillbox again (86.3%) and recommend it to others (95.4%). Overall, 52.4% selected the pillbox in the choice condition and those who did not cited issues related to study requirements. Less than 1% of pillbox alerts were for medication being consumed outside the dosing window and we observed no evidence of actual or attempted methadone diversion. DISCUSSION: We were able to adequately manage patients who would not otherwise qualify for large quantities of take-home methadone when we dispensed methadone tablets via a secure pillbox. The integration of a commercially available pillbox into routine clinic operations increases opportunity for dispensing medication.

We evaluated long-term safety, tolerability, and treatment outcomes of injectable, intramuscular, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in opioid-dependent HCPs. Methods: This single-arm, multisite, open-label study was conducted in opioid-dependent HCPs who had been detoxified from opioids for at least 2 weeks. Subjects received monthly XR-NTX injections for up to 24 months, combined with counseling via intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment programs. Assessments included monthly urine opioid drug tests and routine safety assessments, along with a trimonthly short form (36) Health Survey, opioid craving questionnaire, and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication. Results: Of 49 opioid-dependent HCPs screened, 38 enrolled and received at least 1 XR-NTX injection. Most were female (n=31) and nurses or nursing assistants (n=30). More than half (n=21; 55.3%) received at least 12 injections. Seven discontinued due to adverse events (3 anxiety, 2 headache, 1 injection-site mass, 1 derealization). None experienced relapses to opioid dependence necessitating detoxification, overdose, or death during treatment. At 24 months, mean opioid craving fell by 45.2%, and short form (36) mental component scores improved by 31.1% from baseline and approached normal levels. Of 22 unemployed subjects at baseline, 45.5% improved employment status at 24 months. Conclusions: Long-term (2 years) XR-NTX was associated with no new safety concerns, and, compared with shorter-term studies in the general population, similar or better rates of retention, opioid-negative urines, opioid craving reduction, mental health functional quality of life improvement, and re-employment.","Comments":"2017-06-22","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Earley P H; Zummo J ; Memisoglu A ; Silverman B L; Gastfriend D R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000302","Keywords":"naltrexone\r\nabstinence\r\nadult\r\nanxiety\r\narthralgia\r\narticle\r\nbronchitis\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled release formulation\r\ncounseling\r\ndecreased appetite\r\ndepersonalization\r\ndepression\r\ndetoxification\r\ndiarrhea\r\ndizziness\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug dependence treatment\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nextended release formulation\r\nfatigue\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\ninjection site mass\r\ninjection site pain\r\nmale\r\nmedication compliance\r\nmulticenter study\r\nnausea\r\nneuralgia\r\nnurse\r\nnursing assistant\r\nopen study\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutpatient care\r\npriority journal\r\nquality of life\r\nShort Form 36\r\nside effect\r\nsinusitis\r\nupper respiratory tract infection\r\nurinalysis\r\nvomiting\r\nwork resumption\r\nvivitrol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Earley P H, Zummo J, Memisoglu A, Silverman B L, and Gastfriend D R (2017) Open-label Study of Injectable Extended-release Naltrexone (XR-NTX) in Healthcare Professionals with Opioid Dependence.

Due to its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which has been shown to block rewarding and reinforcing effects of morphine, memantine has been investigated for potential utilization in opioid use disorder (OUD). The objective of this systematic review is to assess the evidence available to determine the safety and efficacy of memantine as treatment for OUD. Pubmed (1946-August 2019) and Embase (1947-August 2019) were queried using the following search terms: opioid-related disorders, opioids, substance withdrawal syndrome, withdrawal syndrome, opiate addiction, opiate, opiate dependence, opiate substitution treatment, managed opioid withdrawal, or drug withdrawal and memantine. After assessing studies appropriate for the objective, one single-blind and five double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were included. Of the included studies, four demonstrated beneficial effects of memantine either as monotherapy or adjunct to methadone or buprenorphine on reducing opioid cravings and methadone dose, increasing retention rates, and improving cognitive performance in patients with OUD. Two studies did not show benefit on patient retention rates with memantine adjunct to naltrexone. Study durations ranged from 3 to 13 weeks, and memantine dosing ranged from 5 to 60 mg/day. Memantine was well tolerated with similar rates of adverse effects between treatment groups. Based on the reviewed literature, memantine appears most beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for OUD when combined with methadone or buprenorphine, but not naltrexone. Larger studies with longer periods of treatment and follow-up are needed to support the use of memantine in the management of OUD.","Comments":"2019-11-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Elias A M; Pepin M J; Brown J N; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2019.10.003","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmemantine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\narticle\r\nclinical assessment\r\nclinical evaluation\r\ncognition\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug mechanism\r\ndrug safety\r\nhuman\r\nmonotherapy\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nsystematic review\r\nvisual analog scale\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Elias A M, Pepin M J, and Brown J N (2019) Adjunctive memantine for opioid use disorder treatment: A systematic review.

METHODS: The OPTIMA study was a pragmatic, open-label, noninferiority, two-arm randomized controlled trial, to assess the comparative effectiveness of flexible take-home BNX vs. methadone in routine clinical care for individuals with prescription-type opioid use disorder. We evaluated cost-effectiveness using a semi-Markov cohort model. Probabilities of overdose were calibrated, accounting for fentanyl prevalence and other overdose risk factors such as naloxone availability. We considered health sector and societal cost perspectives, including costs (2020 CAD) for treatment, health resource use, criminal activity, and health state-specific preference weights as outcomes to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Six-month and lifetime (3% annual discount rate) time-horizons were explored. RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, individuals accumulated -0.144 [CI: -0.302, -0.025] incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in BNX compared with methadone. Incremental costs were -$2047 [CI: -$39,197, $24,250] from a societal perspective, and -$4549 [CI: -$6332, -$3001] from a health sector perspective. Over a six-month time-horizon, individuals accumulated 0.002 [credible interval (CI): -0.011, 0.016] incremental QALYs in BNX compared with methadone. Incremental costs were -$307 [CI: -$10,385, $8466] from a societal perspective and -$1111 [CI: -$1517, -$631] from a health sector perspective. BNX was dominated (costlier, less effective) in 49.7% of simulations when adopting a societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible take-home BNX was not cost-effective versus methadone over a lifetime time horizon, resulting from better treatment retention in methadone compared to BNX.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Enns B ; Krebs E ; Whitehurst DGT ; Jutras-Aswad D ; Le Foll B ; Socias ME ; Nosyk B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.109893 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPrescriptions\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nCost-effectiveness\r\nEconomics\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid agonist therapy\r\nOpioid treatment\r\nOpioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Enns B, Krebs E, Whitehurst DGT, Jutras-Aswad D, Le Foll B, Socias ME, and Nosyk B (2023) Cost-effectiveness of flexible take-home buprenorphine-naloxone versus methadone for treatment of prescription-type opioid use disorder..

The population of this study included men with substance abuse disorder, who were under methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in two outpatient methadone clinics in the city of Mashhad from 2014 to 2015. From among them, 60 were selected randomly and allocated to an experimental group and a control group (n = 30 per group). The experimental group underwent eight 1.5 hour sessions of therapeutic interventions held once a week. The tools for data collection consisted of cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire. The control and experimental groups were similar in terms of mean age, education level, and duration of abuse. Results: While similar in pretest, the two groups obtained significantly different scores in the posttest, suggesting the effectiveness of group therapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of integrated treatment of chronic HCV infection among PWID. METHODS AND FINDINGS: INTRO-HCV is a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants recruited from opioid agonist therapy (OAT) and community care clinics in Norway over 2017 to 2019 were randomly 1:1 assigned to the 2 treatment approaches. Integrated treatment was delivered by multidisciplinary teams at opioid agonist treatment clinics or community care centers (CCCs) for people with substance use disorders. This included on-site testing for HCV, liver fibrosis assessment, counseling, treatment, and posttreatment follow-up. Standard treatment was delivered in hospital outpatient clinics. Oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications were administered in both arms. The study was not completely blinded. The primary outcomes were time-to-treatment initiation and sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after treatment completion, analyzed with intention to treat, and presented as hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Among 298 included participants, 150 were randomized to standard treatment, of which 116/150 (77%) initiated treatment, with 108/150 (72%) initiating within 1 year of referral. Among those 148 randomized to integrated care, 145/148 (98%) initiated treatment, with 141/148 (95%) initiating within 1 year of referral. The HR for the time to initiating treatment in the integrated arm was 2.2 (1.7 to 2.9) compared to standard treatment. SVR was confirmed in 123 (85% of initiated/83% of all) for integrated treatment compared to 96 (83% of initiated/64% of all) for the standard treatment (OR among treated: 1.5 [0.8 to 2.9], among all: 2.8 [1.6 to 4.8]). No severe adverse events were linked to the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated treatment for HCV in PWID was superior to standard treatment in terms of time-to-treatment initiation, and subsequently, more people achieved SVR.

Self-reported cravings for heroin and cocaine are compared in opioid dependent patients while receiving maintenance treatment with slow-release oral morphine (SROM) or methadone. METHODS: Data from a 22-week open-label, randomized, crossover trial (per protocol sample n = 157) were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Cravings for heroin and cocaine during the past 7 days were assessed at baseline and thrice during each 11-week treatment period using a Visual Analog Scale (heroin, VAS-H; cocaine, VAS-C), German versions of the brief Heroin Craving Questionnaire (HCQ), and the brief Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). RESULTS: Mean (SD) heroin craving scores under methadone were 3.3 (2.4) (VAS-H) and 2.9 (1.4) (HCQ). Heroin craving scores under SROM were significantly lower, at 2.5 (2.2) (VAS-H) and 2.6 (1.2) (HCQ) (ANOVA: VAS-H P < 0.0001, HCQ P = 0.010). Cocaine craving scores were not significantly different (methadone: 1.6 (2.0) (VAS-C) and 2.1 (1.2) (CCQ) vs SROM: 1.4 (1.9) (VAS-C) and 2.1 (1.2) (CCQ); ANOVA: VAS-C P = 0.175, CCQ P = 0.536). No significant carry-over effects were detected.

The aim of this 4-year trial is to assess the clinical utility, effectiveness, and cost implications of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®; Alkermes Inc.) alone and in conjunction with patient navigation for jail inmates with opioid use disorder (OUD). METHODS: Opioid-dependent inmates will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions before being released to the community to include: 1) XR-NTX only; 2) XR-NTX plus patient navigation (PN), and 3) enhanced treatment-as-usual (ETAU) with drug education and a community treatment referral. Before release from jail, participants in the XR-NTX and XR-NTX plus PN conditions will receive their first XR-NTX injection. Those in the XR-NTX plus PN condition also will meet with a patient navigator. Participants in both XR-NTX conditions will be scheduled for medical management sessions twice monthly for months 1-3, monthly medical management sessions for months 4-6, with monthly injections for 5months post-release (which, given the pre-release injection, results in a 6-month medication phase). Follow-up data collection will occur at 1, 3, 6, and 12months post release. RESULTS: We discuss the study's rationale, aims, methods, and anticipated findings. The primary outcome is the presence of a DSM 5 OUD diagnosis 1year after randomization (6months after the end of the active treatment phase). DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that providing XR-NTX prior to release from jail will be particularly beneficial for this extremely high-risk population by reducing opioid use, associated criminal behavior, and injection-related disease risk.

The objective of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®; Alkermes Inc) alone or in conjunction with patient navigation (XR-NTX + PN) for jail inmates with OUD. We randomized a sample of 135 sentenced jail inmates with moderate to severe OUD to (1) XR-NTX only; (2) XR-NTX + PN; or (3) enhanced treatment-as-usual (ETAU) with drug education, each initiated prior to release from jail. We scheduled follow-up data assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-release. Primary outcomes were opioid use (based on Timeline Followback Interview and Addiction Severity Index) and meeting CIDI DSM-5 criteria for OUD 6 months postrelease. We also measured treatment adherence, HIV risk, and recidivism. XR-NTX participants received a mean of 2.26 of 7 possible injections compared to XR-NTX + PN participants, who received a mean of 2.93 injections (Cohen's d = 0.33, 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.74). Thirty-six percent of patients in XR-NTX + PN attended at least one postrelease PN session. We found no significant differences by study condition six months after release from jail for the primary outcomes of any opioid use (ETAU: 17%, XR-NTX: 16%, XR-NTX + PN: 29%) and past 30-day OUD (ETAU: 8%, XR-NTX: 11%, XR-NTX + PN: 10%). Secondary outcomes of rearrest and HIV risk also were similar across groups, with the exception of lower sex-related HIV risk among those in the XR-NTX condition at 12 months. This study did not show superior outcomes of XR-NTX or XR-NTX + PN with regard to opioid use or recidivism outcomes, relative to ETAU. It did, however, highlight the difficulties with adherence to XR-NTX and PN interventions in OUD patients initiating treatment in jail.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farabee D ; Condon T ; Hallgren KA ; McCrady B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108076 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Patient Navigation\r\n*Prisoners\r\nExperimental\r\nExtended release naltrexone\r\nInjectable naltrexone\r\nJail inmates\r\nOpioid dependence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farabee D, Condon T, Hallgren KA, and McCrady B (2020) A randomized comparison of extended-release naltrexone with or without patient navigation vs enhanced treatment-as-usual for incarcerated adults with opioid use disorder..

Methadone has been the standard medication for the management of heroin craving. OBJECTIVES: We explored the medication options other than methadone which may have heroin anticraving properties. METHODS: To be selected for the review, articles had to include outcome measures of the effect of the studied medication on subjective and/or objective opiate craving and be of the following two types: (1) randomized, controlled, and/or double-blind clinical trials (RCTs) examining the relationship between the studied medication and heroin craving; (2) nonrandomized and observational studies (NRSs) examining the relationship between the studied medication and heroin craving. Thirty-three articles were initially included in the review. Twenty-one were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. We present the results of 12 articles that met all the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Some new medications have been under investigation and seem promising for the treatment of opiate craving. Buprenorphine is the second most studied medication after methadone for its effect on opiate craving. At doses above 8 mg daily, it seems very promising and practical for managing opiate craving in patients receiving long-term opioid maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In doses higher than 8 mg daily, buprenorphine is an appropriate treatment for opiate craving. More research with rigorous methodology is needed to study the effect of buprenorphine on heroin craving. Also more studies are needed to directly compare buprenorphine and methadone with regard to their effects on heroin craving.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fareed A ; Vayalapalli S ; Casarella J ; Amar R ; Drexler K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00952990.2010.505991 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nHeroin\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy/rehabilitation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fareed A, Vayalapalli S, Casarella J, Amar R, and Drexler K (2010) Heroin anticraving medications: a systematic review..

For patients who continue to use illicit opiates while prescribed this dose range, clinicians may consider doses greater than 100 mg daily.

There are limited evidence-based guidelines for treatment of this comorbidity. Symptoms of PTSD and opiate dependence may converge, and it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between both conditions. For example, opioid withdrawal symptoms may mimic the hypervigilance and exacerbated startle response of patients with PTSD. A common neurobiologic circuit is suggested for the pathophysiologic mechanism of this comorbidity. There is evidence that opioid substitution therapy may improve treatment outcomes for opioid addiction in patients with comorbid PTSD and opioid dependence. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic intervention is recommended for this population to improve the psychological outcome as well.

However, as with all opioids, methadone impacts negatively on sexual function. To counter this, Rosa Damascena oil (RDO) has been used successfully for opioid-dependent male patients under MMT and with methadone-related sexual dysfunction (MRSD). In the present study, we tested the possible influence of RDO on sexual function and sex hormones of opioid-dependent female patients undergoing MMT and with MRSD. Methods Fifty female patients (mean age: 38.8 years) diagnosed with OUD, undergoing MMT and with MRSD were randomly assigned either to the RDO or the placebo condition. At baseline, patients completed questionnaires covering socio-demographic and OUD-related information. At baseline, and four and eight weeks later they additionally completed questionnaires on sexual function and happiness. Blood samples to assess thyroid hormones, prolactin, progesterone, and estradiol levels were taken at baseline and eight weeks later (end of the study). Results Over time sexual function and happiness increased, but more so in the RDO condition than in the placebo condition. Over time, prolactin decreased, and progesterone, and estradiol increased, but again more so in the RDO condition. Sex hormone levels and sexual function were statistically unrelated. Conclusions Results from this double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial showed that opioid-dependent females undergoing MMT and with MRDS did benefit from RDO administration, as sexual function and happiness increased, and female sexual hormone levels changed in positive directions.","Comments":"2020-10-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Farnia V ; Tatari F ; Alikhani M ; Yazdchi K ; Taghizadeh M ; Sadeghi Bahmani ; D  ; Karbasizadeh H ; Holsboer-Trachsler E ; Brand S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpsychires.2017.08.011","Keywords":"IRCT2015091523705N2\r\nagents acting on the genital system\r\nessential oil\r\nestradiol\r\nliothyronine\r\nmethadone\r\nplacebo\r\nprogesterone\r\nprolactin\r\nRosa damascena essential oil\r\nthyroid hormone\r\nthyrotropin\r\nthyroxine\r\nunclassified drug\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\nestradiol blood level\r\nfemale\r\nfemale sexual dysfunction\r\nhuman\r\nliothyronine blood level\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\norgasm\r\npriority journal\r\nprogesterone blood level\r\nprolactin blood level\r\nquestionnaire\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nRosa damascena\r\nself evaluation\r\nsexual function\r\nsexual satisfaction\r\nthyroid hormone blood level\r\nthyrotropin blood level\r\nthyroxine blood level\r\nvaginal lubrication","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Farnia V, Tatari F, Alikhani M, Yazdchi K, Taghizadeh M, Sadeghi Bahmani, D , Karbasizadeh H, Holsboer-Trachsler E, and Brand S (2017) Rosa Damascena oil improved methadone-related sexual dysfunction in females with opioid use disorder under methadone maintenance therapy – results from a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial.

The present review focuses on the prescription of heroin to heroin-dependent individuals. OBJECTIVES: To compare heroin maintenance to methadone or other substitution treatments for opioid dependence regarding: efficacy and acceptability, retaining patients in treatment, reducing the use of illicit substances, and improving health and social functioning. SEARCH STRATEGY: A review of the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2005) and CINAHL until 2005 (on OVID) was conducted. Personal communication with researchers in the field of heroin prescription identified other ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of heroin maintenance treatment (alone or combined with methadone) were compared with any other pharmacological treatment for heroin-dependent individuals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies involving 2007 patients were included. Results show marginal significance in favour of heroin for remaining in treatment until the end of the study (8 studies, N= 2007, RR=1.23, 95%CI=0.96-1.57; heterogeneity P < 0.01). Adverse events are significantly more frequent in the heroin group. Heroin plus methadone prescription for maintenance treatment in adult chronic opioid users who failed previous methadone treatment attempts decreases the use of other illicit substances (3 Studies, N=1289, RR=0.63, 95%CI=0.49, 0.81, heterogeneity P=0.21), and reduces the risk of being incarcerated (2 studies, N=1103, RR=0.64, 95%CI=0.51-0.79, heterogeneity P=0.31). In addition, we also found a marginally significant protective effect of heroin prescription plus methadone for the use of street heroin (3 studies, N=1512, RR=0.70, 95%CI=0.49-1.00, heterogeneity P < 0.01) and for criminal activity (4 studies, N=1377, RR=0.80, 95%CI=0.61-1.04, heterogeneity P=0.31). There was not enough power to detect statistically significant results for the risk of death (5 studies, N=1817, RR=0.77, 95%CI=0.32-1.87, heterogeneity P=0.79). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests a small added value of heroin prescribed alongside flexible doses of methadone for long-term, treatment-refractory opioid users, considering a decrease in the use of street heroin and other illicit substances, and in the probability of being imprisoned; and an increase in retention in treatment. Due to the higher rate of serious adverse events, heroin prescription should remain a treatment of last resort for people who are currently or have in the past failed maintenance treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ferri M ; Davoli M ; Perucci CA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD003410.pub3 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCrime/statistics & numerical data\r\nHeroin/*therapeutic use\r\nHeroin Dependence/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ferri M, Davoli M, and Perucci CA (2010) Heroin maintenance for chronic heroin-dependent individuals..

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies involving 2007 patients met the inclusion criteria. Five studies compared supervised injected heroin plus flexible dosages of methadone treatment to oral methadone only and showed that heroin helps patients to remain in treatment (valid data from 4 studies, N=1388 Risk Ratio 1.44 (95%CI 1.19-1.75) heterogeneity P=0.03), and to reduce use of illicit drugs. Maintenance with supervised injected heroin has a not statistically significant protective effect on mortality (4 studies, N=1477 Risk Ratio 0.65 (95% CI 0.25-1.69) heterogeneity P=0.89), but it exposes at a greater risk of adverse events related to study medication (3 studies N=373 Risk Ratio 13.50 (95% CI 2.55-71.53) heterogeneity P=0.52). Results on criminal activity and incarceration were not possible to be pooled but where the outcome were measured results of single studies do provide evidence that heroin provision can reduce criminal activity and incarceration/imprisonment. Social functioning improved in all the intervention groups with heroin groups having slightly better results. If all the studies comparing heroin provision in any conditions vs any other treatment are pooled the direction of effect remain in favour of heroin. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests an added value of heroin prescribed alongside flexible doses of methadone for long-term, treatment refractory, opioid users, to reach a decrease in the use of illicit substances, involvement in criminal activity and incarceration, a possible reduction in mortaliity; and an increase in retention in treatment. Due to the higher rate of serious adverse events, heroin prescription should remain a treatment for people who are currently or have in the past failed maintenance treatment, and it should be provided in clinical settings where proper follow-up is ensured.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ferri M ; Davoli M ; Perucci CA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD003410.pub4 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCrime/prevention & control\r\nHeroin/*therapeutic use\r\nHeroin Dependence/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ferri M, Davoli M, and Perucci CA (2011) Heroin maintenance for chronic heroin-dependent individuals..

An open question remains whether slow-release oral morphine (SROM) could represent a possible alternative for opioid-dependent people who respond poorly to other available maintenance treatments. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of SROM as an alternative maintenance pharmacotherapy for the treatment of opioid dependence. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2013), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials assessing efficacy of SROM compared with other maintenance treatment or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Three studies with 195 participants were included in the review. Two were cross-over trials and one was a parallel group RCT. The retention in treatment appeared superior to 80% in all the three studies (without significant difference with controls). Nevertheless, it has to be underlined that the studies had different durations. One lasted six months, and the other two lasted six and seven weeks. The use of opioids during SROM provision varied from lower to non-statistically or clinically different from comparison interventions, whereas there were no differences as far as the use of other substances was concerned.SROM seemed to be equal to comparison interventions for severity of dependence, or mental health/social functioning, but there was a trend for less severe opiate withdrawal symptoms in comparison with methadone (withdrawal score 2.2 vs. 4.8, P value = 0.06). Morphine was generally well tolerated and was preferred by a proportion of participants (seven of nine people in one study). Morphine appeared to reduce cravings, depressive symptoms (measured using the Beck Depression Inventory; P value < 0.001), physical complaints (measured using the Beschwerde-Liste (BL); P value < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (P value = 0.008). Quality of life in people treated with SROM resulted in no significant difference or a worst outcome than in those taking methadone and buprenorphine. Other social functioning measures, such as finances, family and overall satisfaction, scored better in people maintained with the comparison substances than in those maintained with SROM. In particular, people taking methadone showed more favourable values for leisure time (5.4 vs. 3.7, P value < 0.001), housing (6.1 vs. 4.7, P value < 0.023), partnerships (5.7 vs. 4.2, P value = 0.034), friend and acquaintances (5.6 vs. 4.4, P value = 0.003), mental health (5.0 vs. 3.4, P value = 0.002) and self esteem (8.2 vs. 5.7, P value = 0.002) compared to people taking SROM; while people taking buprenorphine obtained better scores for physical health.Medical adverse events were consistently higher in people in SROM than in the comparison groups. None of the studies included people with a documented poor response to other maintenance treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The present review did not identify sufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of SROM for opioid maintenance because only three studies meeting our inclusion criteria have been identified. Two studies suggested a possible reduction of opioid use in people taking SROM. In another study, the use of SROM was associated with fewer depressive symptoms. Retention in treatment was not significantly different among compared interventions while the adverse effects were more frequent with the people given SROM.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ferri M ; Minozzi S ; Bo A ; Amato L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD009879.pub2 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nHumans\r\nMorphine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nNarcotics/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ferri M, Minozzi S, Bo A, and Amato L (2013) Slow-release oral morphine as maintenance therapy for opioid dependence..

Self-report and chart review assessments were conducted every 3 months (quarters 1-4) for 1 year. Outcomes were buprenorphine/naloxone treatment retention, drug use, and addiction treatment processes. RESULTS: Among 303 patients enrolled between July 2005 and December 2007, retention in buprenorphine/naloxone treatment was 74%, 67%, 59%, and 49% during Quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Past 30-day illicit opioid use decreased from 84% of patients at baseline to 42% in retained patients over the year. Patients were 52% less likely to use illicit opioids for each quarter in treatment (Odds ratio = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.72).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of buprenorphine taper vs ongoing maintenance therapy in primary care-based treatment for prescription opioid dependence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a 14-week randomized clinical trial that enrolled 113 patients with prescription opioid dependence from February 17, 2009, through February 1, 2013, in a single primary care site. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to buprenorphine taper (taper condition) or ongoing buprenorphine maintenance therapy (maintenance condition). The buprenorphine taper was initiated after 6 weeks of stabilization, lasted for 3 weeks, and included medications for opioid withdrawal, after which patients were offered naltrexone treatment. The maintenance group received ongoing buprenorphine therapy. All patients received physician and nurse support and drug counseling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Illicit opioid use via results of urinanalysis and patient report, treatment retention, and reinitiation of buprenorphine therapy (taper group only). RESULTS: During the trial, the mean percentage of urine samples negative for opioids was lower for patients in the taper group (35.2% [95% CI, 26.2%-44.2%]) compared with those in the maintenance group (53.2% [95% CI, 44.3%-62.0%]). Patients in the taper group reported more days per week of illicit opioid use than those in the maintenance group once they were no longer receiving buprenorphine (mean use, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.60-1.94] vs 0.47 [95% CI, 0.19-0.74] days). Patients in the taper group had fewer maximum consecutive weeks of opioid abstinence compared with those in the maintenance group (mean abstinence, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.72-3.75] vs 5.20 [95% CI, 4.16-6.20] weeks). Patients in the taper group were less likely to complete the trial (6 of 57 [11%] vs 37 of 56 [66%]; P < .001). Sixteen patients in the taper group reinitiated buprenorphine treatment after the taper owing to relapse. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Tapering is less efficacious than ongoing maintenance treatment in patients with prescription opioid dependence who receive buprenorphine therapy in primary care.

Developmental differences are broadly implicated, but particular vulnerability factor interactions are poorly understood. This study sought to identify moderators of OUD relapse between age groups. METHODS: This secondary analysis compared young adults (18-25) to older adults (26+) from a comparative effectiveness trial (\"XBOT\") that randomized (N = 570) participants to extended-release naltrexone or sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone. We explored the relationship between 25 prespecified patient baseline characteristics and relapse to regular opioid use by age group and treatment condition, using logistic regression. RESULTS: Young adults (n = 111) had higher rates of 24-week relapse than older adults (n = 459) (70.3% vs 58.8%) and differed on a number of specific characteristics, including more smokers, more intravenous opioid use, and more cannabis use. No significant moderators predicted relapse, in either three-way or two-way interactions. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: No baseline factors were identified as moderating the relationship between age group and opioid relapse, nor any interactions between baseline characteristics, age group, and treatment condition to predict opioid relapse. Poorer treatment outcomes for young adults are likely associated with multiple developmental vulnerabilities rather than any single predominant factor. Although not reaching significance, several characteristics (using heroin, smoking tobacco, high levels of depression/anxiety, or treatment because of family/friends) showed higher odds ratio point estimates for relapse in young adults than older adults. This is the first study to explore moderators of worse OUD treatment outcomes in young adults, highlighting the need to identify predictor variables that could inform treatment enhancements.

The current pharmacotherapy is mainly focused on opioid and adrenergic receptors. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is among other receptors that can also be targeted to treat the disease. Findings from randomized controlled trials (RTCs) on NMDAR antagonists to treat severe opioid use disorder amply varied. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and assess the potential risks for adverse events or side effects of NMDAR antagonists that were investigated for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder. Methods: Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Proquest. Cochrane Review Database, Medline Ovid, and EMBASE from their inception to March 2019. RTCs on NMDAR antagonists for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder were independently screened and assessed by two authors. The results were synthesized qualitatively. Results: Nineteen RTCs of 1459 participants met the inclusion criteria. There is moderate evidence suggesting that ketamine, memantine, amantadine, and dextromethorphan may be able to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is little evidence suggesting that memantine may be able to reduce methadone maintenance dose in participants on methadone, reduce opioid use, and reduce craving. Dropout is noticeable among dextromethorphan's participants. Safety concerns are more likely associated with dextromethorphan and ketamine. Conclusions: NMDAR antagonists have the potentiality to treat severe opioid use disorder. There is insufficient evidence to recommend them for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder due to several limitations inherent to the RCTs reviewed. Further exploration is needed.","Comments":"2020-02-03","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fluyau D ; Revadigar N ; Pierre C G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.107845","Keywords":"amantadine\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ndextromethorphan\r\nketamine\r\nmemantine\r\nmethadone\r\nn methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor blocking agent\r\nnaloxone\r\nplacebo\r\ncombination drug therapy\r\ndetoxification\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug dose reduction\r\ndrug effect\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug targeting\r\nED50\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmeta analysis\r\nnonhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient dropout\r\npriority journal\r\nqualitative analysis\r\nreview\r\nrisk assessment\r\nrisk factor\r\nside effect\r\nsystematic review\r\ntherapy effect\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fluyau D, Revadigar N, and Pierre C G (2020) Clinical benefits and risks of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists to treat severe opioid use disorder: A systematic review.

PURPOSE: To synthesize studies of the effectiveness of strategies to reduce or discontinue LTOT and patient outcomes after dose reduction among adults prescribed LTOT for chronic pain. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from inception through April 2017; reference lists; and expert contacts. STUDY SELECTION: Original research published in English that addressed dose reduction or discontinuation of LTOT for chronic pain. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force quality rating criteria. All authors assessed evidence quality using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system. Prespecified patient outcomes were pain severity, function, quality of life, opioid withdrawal symptoms, substance use, and adverse events. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-seven studies (11 randomized trials and 56 observational studies) examining 8 intervention categories, including interdisciplinary pain programs, buprenorphine-assisted dose reduction, and behavioral interventions, were found. Study quality was good for 3 studies, fair for 13 studies, and poor for 51 studies. Many studies reported dose reduction, but rates of opioid discontinuation ranged widely across interventions and the overall quality of evidence was very low. Among 40 studies examining patient outcomes after dose reduction (very low overall quality of evidence), improvement was reported in pain severity (8 of 8 fair-quality studies), function (5 of 5 fair-quality studies), and quality of life (3 of 3 fair-quality studies). LIMITATION: Heterogeneous interventions and outcome measures; poor-quality studies with uncontrolled designs. CONCLUSION: Very low quality evidence suggests that several types of interventions may be effective to reduce or discontinue LTOT and that pain, function, and quality of life may improve with opioid dose reduction.

Initiation of extended release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX)) prior to prison release might decrease relapse among opioid-dependent persons. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examined the feasibility and acceptability of XR-NTX injection prior to prison release among adult inmates with opioid use disorder, followed by six months of community XR-NTX treatment. It sought to determine effects on treatment retention and abstinence compared to post-release XR-NTX initiation. METHODS: Recruitment for the study took place at the RIDOC's Adult Correctional Institute (ACI). Volunteers with a history of opioid dependence and a release date scheduled within 1-2months were self-referred in response to recruitment fliers. Consented volunteers were randomized to XR-NTX treatment prior to release followed by 5 monthly treatments in the community (pre-release) or six XR-NTX treatments in the community (post-release). RESULTS: Of 26 volunteers consented, 15 were randomized (9 pre-release, 6 post-release). The pre-release group generally had better treatment retention: 100% received the first NTX injection (vs. 67% post-release), 78% received more than one injection (vs. 17%) and 22% received all 6 injections (vs. 0%). The pre-release group also had greater abstinence, with a higher proportion of self-reported opioid free days in the first month after release (83% vs. 46%, fewer positive urine drug tests in the 6months after release (22% vs. 33%), and more days of opioid receptor blockade during the first two weeks after release, a high risk time for overdose death. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of XR-NTX injection prior to release from prison might be an effective approach to reduce relapse to opioids, but these findings require confirmation in a larger trial.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Friedmann PD ; Wilson D ; Hoskinson R Jr; Poshkus M ; Clarke JG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2017.04.010 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPilot Projects\r\n*Prisoners\r\nRecurrence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Friedmann PD, Wilson D, Hoskinson R Jr, Poshkus M, and Clarke JG (2018) Initiation of extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder prior to release from prison..

Baseline factors, including patients' demographics, comorbidities and lifestyle, may help identify patients who will benefit most or least from XR-NTX treatment. METHODS: Potential moderators of XR-NTX's effect were examined in the largest North American randomized open-label effectiveness trial of XR-NTX. Relapse status (Yes/No) at 6-month follow-up was regressed on treatment group (XR-NTX, N=153; or Treatment-as-Usual [TAU], N=155), baseline covariates, and their two-way interaction to identify moderator effects. Baseline covariates included age, gender, summary scores for depression, suicidal thoughts, drug abuse risk, substance use, medical, psychiatric and employment status, socialization, legal and family/social issues, history of abuse and quality of life measures. RESULTS: Alcohol use to intoxication in the 30days before randomization was a significant moderator: during the treatment phase, those who reported being recently intoxicated before randomization to XR-NTX relapsed to opioids at a rate (56%) similar to TAU (58%), while those without alcohol intoxication in the prior 30days had a lower rate of opioid relapse (41% vs. 65%, respectively, P<0.04). CONCLUSIONS: XR-NTX appeared to work equally well across subgroups with diverse demographic, addiction, mental health and environmental characteristics, with the possible exception of working better among those without recent alcohol intoxication. These findings should be reassuring to practitioners increasingly using XR-NTX as medical addiction therapy in diverse and often vulnerable populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Friedmann PD ; Wilson D ; Nunes EV ; Hoskinson R Jr; Lee JD ; Gordon M ; Murphy SM ; Bonnie RJ ; Chen DT ; Boney TY ; O'Brien CP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2017.01.018 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlcoholic Intoxication/complications\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\n*Secondary Prevention\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Friedmann PD, Wilson D, Nunes EV, Hoskinson R Jr, Lee JD, Gordon M, Murphy SM, Bonnie RJ, Chen DT, Boney TY, and O'Brien CP (2018) Do patient characteristics moderate the effect of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid use disorder?.

DESIGN: Phase 3, open-label, observational, multi-centre 48-week trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02672111). SETTING: Twenty-six out-patient sites (United States, United Kingdom, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Australia) between 14 December 2015 and 12 April 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and twenty-eight adults with opioid use disorder; 227 received CAM2038 (37 initiated onto CAM2038 and 190 converted from sublingual buprenorphine). INTERVENTIONS: CAM2038 weekly (8, 16, 24 or 32 mg) or monthly (64, 96, 128 or 160 mg) with flexible dosing and individualized titration utilizing multiple CAM2038 weekly and monthly doses. MEASUREMENTS: Safety variables, urine toxicology samples and self-reported illicit opioid use were collected at each visit. Participants were administered a patient satisfaction survey at months 6 and 12, completed by 162 of 227 (71.4%) participants. FINDINGS: The study treatment period was completed by 167 of 227 (73.6%) participants. At least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was reported by 143 of 227 (63.0%) participants, of whom 60 of 227 (26.4%) reported as being drug-related. Most of the TEAEs, reported by 128 of 227 (56.4%) of participants, were mild or moderate in intensity. Injection-site reactions were reported by 46 of 227 (20.3%) participants, with most [45 of 46 (97.8%)] reported as mild to moderate. Five participants (2.2%) discontinued the study drug due to a TEAE, two cases (0.9%) of which were injection-site-related. No serious adverse events were attributed to the study drug. Among those remaining in the study, the percentage of opioid-negative urine tests combined with self-reports was 63.0% (17 of 27) in new-to-treatment participants and 82.8% (111 of 134) for those converted from sublingual buprenorphine. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with CAM2038. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous buprenorphine delivered weekly or monthly (CAM2038) was well tolerated, with a systemic safety profile consistent with the known profile of sublingual buprenorphine. CAM2038 weekly and monthly was associated with high retention rates and low levels of illicit opioid use throughout this study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Frost M ; Bailey GL ; Lintzeris N ; Strang J ; Dunlop A ; Nunes EV ; Jansen JB ; Frey LC ; Weber B ; Haber P ; Oosman S ; Kim S ; Tiberg F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.14636 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage\r\nAustralia\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/*administration & dosage\r\nDenmark\r\nDrug Monitoring\r\nFemale\r\nGermany\r\nHumans\r\nHungary\r\nInjections, Subcutaneous\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nOutpatients/psychology\r\nPatient Safety\r\nPatient Satisfaction\r\nSweden\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nUnited States\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nCAM2038\r\nPhase 3 trial\r\ndepot\r\nlong-term safety\r\nopioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Frost M, Bailey GL, Lintzeris N, Strang J, Dunlop A, Nunes EV, Jansen JB, Frey LC, Weber B, Haber P, Oosman S, Kim S, and Tiberg F (2019) Long-term safety of a weekly and monthly subcutaneous buprenorphine depot (CAM2038) in the treatment of adult out-patients with opioid use disorder..

Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) helps individuals with an opioid use disorder abstain from or decrease use of illegal or nonmedical opiates. This review examined evidence for MMT's effectiveness. Methods: Authors reviewed meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and individual studies of MMT from 1995 through 2012. Databases searched were PubMed, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress. The authors rated the level of evidence (high, moderate, and low) based on benchmarks for the number of studies and quality of their methodology. They also described the evidence of service effectiveness and examined maternal and fetal results of MMT for pregnant women. Results: The review included seven randomized controlled trials and two quasi-experimental studies of MMT, indicating a high level of evidence for the positive impact of MMT on treatment retention and illicit opioid use, particularly at doses greater than 60 mg. Evidence suggests positive impacts on drugrelated HIV risk behaviors, mortality, and criminality. Meta-analyses were difficult to perform or yielded nonsignificant results. Studies found little association between MMT and sex-related HIV risk behaviors. MMT in pregnancy was associated with improved maternal and fetal outcomes, and rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome were similar for mothers receiving different doses. Reports of adverse events were also found. Conclusions: MMT is associated with improved outcomes for individuals and pregnant women with opioid use disorders. MMT should be a covered service available to all individuals.","Comments":"2014-02-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fullerton C A; Kim M ; Thomas C P; Lyman D R; Montejano L B; Dougherty R H; Daniels A S; Ghose S S; Delphin-Rittmon M E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201300235","Keywords":"methadone\r\nplacebo\r\narticle\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ncriminal behavior\r\ndisease association\r\ndrug efficacy\r\nfetus outcome\r\nhealth care delivery\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\ninfection risk\r\nMedline\r\nmental health service\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmortality\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npatient monitoring\r\npregnancy\r\npregnancy outcome\r\npregnant woman\r\npsychosocial care\r\nPsycINFO\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nsystematic review\r\nunspecified side effect\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fullerton C A, Kim M, Thomas C P, Lyman D R, Montejano L B, Dougherty R H, Daniels A S, Ghose S S, and Delphin-Rittmon M E (2014) Medication-assisted treatment with methadone: Assessing the evidence.

Serious consideration should be given to the modality of methadone distribution, as it influences not only treatment outcome but the attitudes of policy makers and the community, too. On one hand, the choice of take-home methadone removes the need for daily attendance at a methadone clinic, which seems to improve patients' quality of life. On the other, this method, because of its lack of supervision and the absence of strict consumption monitoring, runs the risk of methadone misuse and diversion. In this study, we compared A) supervised daily consumption, B) contingent take-home incentives and C) non-contingent take-home in methadone maintenance in three groups of heroin-addicted patients attending three different MMT programmes. Retention rates at 12 months were significantly higher in contingent take-home patients (group B) than in those with supervised daily consumption (group A) and the non-contingent take-home (group C). Retention rates were higher in group A than in group C patients. Compared to patients in groups A and B, those in group C showed fewer negative urinalyses and higher rates of self-reported diversion and episodes of crime or violence. Results indicate a more positive outcomes following take-home methadone associated with behavioural incentives and other measures that aim to facilitate treatment compliance than those following daily supervised consumption. By contrast, non-contingent take-home methadone given to non-stabilized patients is associated with a high rate of diversion, along with more crime episodes and maladaptive behaviours.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gerra G ; Saenz E ; Busse A ; Maremmani I ; Ciccocioppo R ; Zaimovic A ; Gerra ML ; Amore M ; Manfredini M ; Donnini C ; Somaini L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.12.002 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nComorbidity\r\nCrime\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\n*Heroin\r\nHeroin Dependence/epidemiology/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nInterview, Psychological\r\nMale\r\nMental Disorders/*epidemiology\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nMotivation\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/epidemiology/rehabilitation\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nSelf Report\r\n*Substance Abuse Detection\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nViolence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gerra G, Saenz E, Busse A, Maremmani I, Ciccocioppo R, Zaimovic A, Gerra ML, Amore M, Manfredini M, Donnini C, and Somaini L (2011) Supervised daily consumption, contingent take-home incentive and non-contingent take-home in methadone maintenance..

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) encompasses select medications that are proven effective treatments for OUD. Understanding the mechanisms of action, indications, and implementation of MAT is paramount to increasing its availability to all individuals struggling with opioid addiction. OBJECTIVES: This review is based on an educational series that aims to educate healthcare providers and ancillary healthcare members on the use of MAT for the treatment of OUD. METHODS: The database PubMed was utilized to retrieve articles discussing the implementation of MAT. Boolean operators and Medical Subject Headings (MeSHs) were applied including: MAT and primary care, MAT and telehealth, methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, MAT and osteopathic, MAT and group therapy, and MAT and COVID-19. RESULTS: Three medications have been approved for the treatment of OUD: methadone, naltrexone, and buprenorphine. Identifying ways to better treat and manage OUD and to combat stigmatization are paramount to dismantling barriers that have made treatment less accessible. Studies suggest that primary care providers are well positioned to provide MAT to their patients, particularly in rural settings. However, no study has compared outcomes of different MAT models of care, and more research is required to guide future efforts in expanding the role of MAT in primary care settings. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to changes in the way MAT care is managed. Patients require a novel point-of-care approach to obtain care. This review will define the components of MAT, consider the impact of MAT in the primary care setting, and identify barriers to effective MAT. Increasing the availability of MAT treatment will allow for greater access to comprehensive treatment and will set the standard for accessibility of novel OUD treatment in the future.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ghanem N ; Dromgoole D ; Hussein A ; Jermyn RT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1515/jom-2021-0163 ","Keywords":"*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\n*COVID-19/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology/rehabilitation\r\nUnited States\r\n*COVID-19 Drug Treatment\r\nOUD\r\nmedication-assisted treatment\r\nopioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ghanem N, Dromgoole D, Hussein A, and Jermyn RT (2022) Review of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder..

Various pharmacological therapies have been investigated in neonates with NAS. This article reviews all studies on NAS treatment to analyze the duration of treatment, length of hospitalization and possible drug adverse effects. The search was limited to the randomized clinical trials which examined the treatments of neonates with NAS. Scientific databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, Embase and Scopus were systematically searched. Retrieved articles were reviewed by two researchers and evaluated using the JADAD scoring system. Finally, the treatment duration, hospitalization length and drug side-effects were extracted. Methadone, buprenorphine and clonidine were found more effective than morphine. Diluted tincture of opium (DTO) in combination with phenobarbital or clonidine was significantly more effective than DTO alone. Clonidine was a significantly better adjunctive therapy than phenobarbital in reducing morphine treatment days. No significant difference was observed between morphine and DTO effectiveness. Deciding the optimal regimen to manage symptomatic NAS, as a single or an adjunct therapy is not possible based on the literature, due to the low quality, small size and short-term treatment considered in the published studies.

The process of conversion can be difficult given methadone's long half-life and concerns regarding the need for withdrawal before initiation. Purpose: We aim to present several unique methods of converting individuals from methadone and other full opioid agonists (prescribed and illicit) to buprenorphine/naloxone SL as well as describe novel buprenorphine induction protocols to use in community and acute care settings. Methods: A review was conducted using key search databases. Review of publications in peer reviewed journals as well as expert opinions and protocols were used to synthesize this article. Discussion: A description of various protocols, their pros and cons, best setting of use, ease of use, and costs are detailed in the document. Conclusion: Several methods of conversion will provide clinicians with more tools to support transitioning people from methadone and other full agonist opioids to buprenorphine/naloxone SL, as well as reduce withdrawal concerns for buprenorphine induction.","Comments":"2020-01-23","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ghosh S M; Klaire S ; Tanguay R ; Manek M ; Azar P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/CXA.0000000000000072","Keywords":"transdermal patch\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nfentanyl\r\nmethadone\r\nmorphine\r\nopiate agonist\r\nclinical protocol\r\nCochrane Library\r\ncommunity care\r\ndata base\r\ndrug substitution\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nEmbase\r\nemergency care\r\nhuman\r\nintermethod comparison\r\nMedline\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\noutpatient\r\npeer review\r\npublication\r\nreview\r\nscientific literature\r\nsystematic review\r\nbutrans","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ghosh S M, Klaire S, Tanguay R, Manek M, and Azar P (2019) A Review of Novel Methods to Support the Transition from Methadone and Other Full Agonist Opioids to Buprenorphine/Naloxone Sublingual in Both Community and Acute Care Settings.

Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of buprenorphine on QoL among people with OUD. METHODS: Seven databases were searched through August 2020. We included English-language studies with pre- and post- QoL assessments internationally. Standardized mean differences were calculated for five domains of QoL measures using a random effects model for correlated effect sizes with robust variance estimation. Meta-regression was used to assess variation in effect sizes based on QoL domain, treatment, and patient factors. RESULTS: Twenty-one peer-reviewed studies from twelve countries were included. Only three studies included a no-treatment control group and five studies assigned groups using randomization. Improvements between baseline and follow-up were observed across all five domains of QoL measures (overall, physical, psychological, social, and environmental). The certainty of evidence was low for all domains of QoL, and very low for environmental QoL. We did not observe differences in the effect of buprenorphine on QoL by QoL domain, duration, dose, participant characteristics, or adjunctive counseling services. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine treatment likely improves overall, physical, psychological, and social QoL, and may improve environmental QoL, for individuals with OUD. Findings are limited by study quality, including lack of control groups and incomplete reporting. Future studies with more rigorous methods and comprehensive reporting are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Golan OK ; Totaram R ; Perry E ; Fortson K ; Rivera-Atilano R ; Entress R ; Golan M ; Andraka-Christou B ; Whitaker D ; Pigott T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109445 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nCognition\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nMeta-analysis\r\nOpioid Use Disorder\r\nQuality of life\r\nReview","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Golan OK, Totaram R, Perry E, Fortson K, Rivera-Atilano R, Entress R, Golan M, Andraka-Christou B, Whitaker D, and Pigott T (2022) Systematic review and meta-analysis of changes in quality of life following initiation of buprenorphine for opioid use disorder..

We evaluated the relationship between XR-NTX adherence and criminal recidivism (re-arrest and re-incarceration) and opioid and cocaine use. Twenty-seven pre-release male and female prisoners who had opioid disorders during the year prior to index incarceration were recruited and received one XR-NTX injection once each month for 7 months (1 injection pre-release from prison and 6 injections in the community) and of those 27, 10 (37%) were retained in treatment at 7-months post release. Results indicate those completing 6 compared to those completing < 6 injections were less likely to test positive for opioids in the community (0% vs. 62.5%, respectively; p= 0.003). Although not statistically significant, individuals who did not complete all 6 injections were more likely to be re-arrested compared to those completing all 6 community injections (31.3% vs. 0%, respectively; p= 0.123). Contingent upon further study of a randomized controlled trial, XR-NTX may be a feasible option in the prison setting in view of the lack of potential for diversion. Furthermore, these data suggest that completing the entire course of treatment (6 injections) may reduce opioid use and, to a lesser degree, re-arrest and re-incarceration.","Comments":"2015-11-04","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gordon M S; Kinlock T W; Vocci F J; Fitzgerald T T; Memisoglu A ; Silverman B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2015.07.005","Keywords":"cocaine\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncocaine dependence\r\ncommunity\r\ndrug formulation\r\ndrug screening\r\nfeasibility study\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\ninjection\r\nmale\r\nmedical history\r\noffender\r\nopen study\r\nopiate addiction\r\nphase 4 clinical trial\r\npilot study\r\npriority journal\r\ncorrectional facility\r\nprisoner\r\nrecidivism\r\nurinalysis\r\nvivitrol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gordon M S, Kinlock T W, Vocci F J, Fitzgerald T T, Memisoglu A, and Silverman B (2015) A Phase 4, Pilot, Open-Label Study of VIVITROL® (Extended-Release Naltrexone XR-NTX) for Prisoners.

The trial was conducted between September 2008 and July 2012. Follow-up assessments were completed in 2014. Participants were recruited from two Baltimore pre-release prisons (one for men and one for women). Adult pre-release prisoners who were heroin-dependent during the year prior to incarceration were eligible. Post-release assessments were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12-month following prison release.

Mobile treatment for chronic diseases has been implemented in a variety of settings. Mobile treatment may provide an opportunity to expand outreach to parolees to surmount barriers to traditional clinic treatment. METHODS: Male and female prisoners (240) with pre-incarceration histories of opioid use disorder who are within one month of release from prison will be enrolled in this randomized clinical trial. Participants are randomized to one of two study arms: 1) [XR-NTX-OTx] One injection of long-acting naltrexone in prison, followed by 6 monthly injections post-release at a community opioid treatment program; or 2) [XR-NTX+ MMTx] One injection of long-acting naltrexone in prison followed by 6 monthly injections post-release at the patient's place of residence utilizing mobile medical treatment. The primary outcomes are: treatment adherence; opioid use; criminal activity; re-arrest; reincarceration; and HIV risk-behaviors. RESULTS: We describe the background and rationale for the study, its aims, hypotheses, and study design. CONCLUSIONS: The use of long-acting injectable naltrexone may be a promising form of treatment for pre-release prisoners. Finally, as many individuals in the criminal justice system drop out of treatment, this study will assess whether treatment at their place of residence will improve adherence and positively affect treatment outcomes.

Methods: A search conducted on five databases identified studies from database inception to January 26th 2021 that evaluated the effects of PRSS on PRSS engagement, medication for OUD (MOUD) initiation, MOUD retention, opioid and non-opioid misuse, and remission. Characteristics of PRSS interventions, study design, and clinical outcomes were extracted. Methodological quality was assessed with the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies by the Effective Public Health Practice Project. Results: Of 123 titles, 22 were subjected to full-text review and 12 ultimately met inclusion criteria. Only two studies were randomized control trials, half compared the outcomes of PRSS participants to those of a counterfactual group. Most PRSS were unstandardized and broadly described, involving linkage to treatment (91.7%) or follow-up support (91.7%). MOUD initiation was reported the most often (66.7%), followed by PRSS engagement (33.3%) and opioid use (25.0%). No studies reported findings for MOUD retention or remission. Findings for available outcomes were inconsistent and difficult to compare due to the heterogeneity of PRSS interventions and methodological limitations. Conclusion: Effectiveness of PRSS interventions on stages of the OUD treatment cascade remain inconclusive. Additional research is necessary before supporting the implementation of PRSS on a broad scale.","Comments":"2022-03-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gormley M A; Pericot-Valverde I ; Diaz L ; Coleman A ; Lancaster J ; Ortiz E ; Moschella P ; Heo M ; Litwin A H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109123","Keywords":"clinical effectiveness\r\nclinical outcome\r\nconvalescence\r\nfollow up\r\nhealth care utilization\r\nhealth service\r\nhuman\r\ninformation dissemination\r\nmedical research\r\nopiate addiction\r\npeer group\r\npeer recovery support service\r\npolypharmacy\r\nremission\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\ntherapy effect","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gormley M A, Pericot-Valverde I, Diaz L, Coleman A, Lancaster J, Ortiz E, Moschella P, Heo M, and Litwin A H (2021) Effectiveness of peer recovery support services on stages of the opioid use disorder treatment cascade: A systematic review.

Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications, or an alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonist regimen different to the experimental intervention, for the management of the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects, and completion of treatment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1946 to November week 2, 2015), EMBASE (January 1985 to November week 2, 2015), PsycINFO (1806 to November week 2, 2015), Web of Science, and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included 26 randomised controlled trials involving 1728 participants. Six studies compared an alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications, and five compared different alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists. We assessed 10 studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one of the methodological domains that were considered. We found moderate‐quality evidence that alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57; 3 studies; 148 participants). We found moderate‐quality evidence that completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84; 3 studies; 148 participants). Peak withdrawal severity may be greater with alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists than with reducing doses of methadone, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73; 5 studies; 340 participants; low quality), and peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.46; 2 studies; 263 participants; moderate quality), but these differences were not significant and there is no significant difference in severity when considered over the entire duration of the withdrawal episode (SMD 0.13, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.49; 3 studies; 119 participants; moderate quality). The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD ‐1.07, 95% CI ‐1.31 to ‐0.83; 3 studies; 310 participants; low quality). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10; 6 studies; 464 participants; low quality), but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; 9 studies; 659 participants; low quality). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine. Authors' conclusions Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone. We detected no significant difference in efficacy between treatment regimens based on clonidine or lofexidine and those based on reducing doses of methadone over a period of around 10 days, but methadone was associated with fewer adverse effects than clonidine, and lofexidine has a better safety profile than clonidine. Plain language summary Clonidine, lofexidine, and similar medications for the management of opioid withdrawal Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, and tizanidine) in managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (for example heroin, methadone). Background Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a required first step for longer‐term treatments of opioid dependence. The combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completion of opioid withdrawal difficult for most people. For many years, the main approach to detoxification involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose. The use of methadone in this way has been limited by government restrictions on prescription of methadone and dislike of the drawn‐out nature of methadone withdrawal. Clonidine and similar medications (known as alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists) offer an alternative approach. This review considered whether alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists are more effective than reducing doses of methadone, and whether there are any differences in the effectiveness of different types of alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonist. Search date The evidence is current to November 2015. Study characteristics We identified 26 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 1728 opioid‐dependent participants. The studies were undertaken in 12 different countries and involved treatment with an alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonist (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine, and in one study, tizanidine) compared with reducing doses of methadone (12 studies), placebo (six studies), or symptomatic medications (four studies). Five studies compared different alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists. Treatment was scheduled to last for one to two weeks in most studies; the shortest duration was three days, and the longest was 30 days. Six studies received some financial support from a pharmaceutical company. Key results Opioid withdrawal was similar with alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone, but the duration of treatment was longer and there were fewer adverse effects with methadone. Withdrawal signs and symptoms occurred earlier with alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists, within a few days of cessation of the opioid drugs. The chances of completing withdrawal treatment were similar. Clonidine and lofexidine were more effective than placebo in managing withdrawal from heroin or methadone, and were associated with higher chances of completing treatment. Lofexidine had less effect on blood pressure than clonidine. Quality of the evidence For alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, the evidence was very low to moderate quality, indicating that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect made in this review. However, the evidence is sufficient to indicate that alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo, making further comparisons of this nature inappropriate on ethical grounds. For the comparison of alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, the evidence was low to moderate quality. The key reasons for the low quality were small numbers of studies reporting some outcomes, low rates of occurrence of some events (for example drop‐out due to adverse effects), and variability between studies.","Comments":"[Drugs and Alcohol]","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gowing L ; Farrell M ; Ali R ; White JM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD002024.pub5","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nAdrenergic alpha‐2 Receptor Agonists [*therapeutic use]\r\nClonidine [analogs & derivatives, therapeutic use]\r\nControlled Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone [administration & dosage, therapeutic use]\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment [methods]\r\nOpioid‐Related Disorders [*complications]\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome [*rehabilitation]","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gowing L, Farrell M, Ali R, and White JM (2016) Alpha2‐adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal.

Comparators were placebo as well as more established approaches to detoxification, such as tapered doses of methadone, adrenergic agonists, buprenorphine and symptomatic medications. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to December 2016: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science. We also searched two trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials along with prospective controlled cohort studies comparing opioid antagonists plus minimal sedation versus other approaches or different opioid antagonist regimens for withdrawal in opioid-dependent participants. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: Ten studies (6 randomised controlled trials and 4 prospective cohort studies, involving 955 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review. We considered 7 of the 10 studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one of the domains we assessed. Nine studies compared an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus a treatment regimen based primarily on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist (clonidine or lofexidine). Other comparisons (placebo, tapered doses of methadone, buprenorphine) made by included studies were too diverse for any meaningful analysis. This review therefore focuses on the nine studies comparing an opioid antagonist (naltrexone or naloxone) plus clonidine or lofexidine versus treatment primarily based on clonidine or lofexidine. Five studies took place in an inpatient setting, two studies were in outpatients with day care, two used day care only for the first day of opioid antagonist administration, and one study described the setting as outpatient without indicating the level of care provided. The included studies were heterogeneous in terms of the type of opioid antagonist treatment regimen, the comparator, the outcome measures assessed, and the means of assessing outcomes. As a result, the validity of any estimates of overall effect is doubtful, therefore we did not calculate pooled results for any of the analyses. The quality of the evidence for treatment with an opioid antagonist-adrenergic agonist combination versus an alpha2-adrenergic agonist is very low. Two studies reported data on peak withdrawal severity, and four studies reported data on the average severity over the period of withdrawal. Peak withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists in combination with an adrenergic agonist appears to be more severe than withdrawal managed with clonidine or lofexidine alone, but the average severity over the withdrawal period is less. In some situations antagonist-induced withdrawal may be associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion compared to withdrawal managed with adrenergic agonists. However, this result was not consistent across studies, and the extent of any benefit is highly uncertain. We could not extract any data on the occurrence of adverse events, but two studies reported delirium or confusion following the first dose of naltrexone. Delirium may be more likely with higher initial doses and with naltrexone rather than naloxone (which has a shorter half-life), but we could not confirm this from the available evidence. Insufficient data were available to make any conclusions on the best duration of treatment. Authors' conclusions: Using opioid antagonists plus alpha2-adrenergic agonists is a feasible approach for managing opioid withdrawal. However, it is unclear whether this approach reduces the duration of withdrawal or facilitates transfer to naltrexone treatment to a greater extent than withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist. A high level of monitoring and support is desirable for several hours following administration of opioid antagonists because of the possibility of vomiting, diarrhoea and delirium. Using opioid antagonists to induce and accelerate opioid withdrawal is not currently an active area of research or clinical practice, and the research community should give greater priority to investigating approaches, such as those based on buprenorphine, that facilitate the transition to sustained-release preparations of naltrexone.","Comments":"2022-07-19","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gowing L ; Ali R ; White J M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD002021.pub4","Keywords":"adrenergic receptor stimulating agent\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nclonidine\r\nlofexidine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nopiate antagonist\r\nplacebo\r\ncohort analysis\r\nconfusion\r\nday care\r\ndelirium\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug detoxification\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\noutpatient care\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsedation\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment duration\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gowing L, Ali R, and White J M (2017) Opioid antagonists with minimal sedation for opioid withdrawal.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of buprenorphine versus tapered doses of methadone, alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine regimens for managing opioid withdrawal, in terms of the intensity of the withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration and completion of treatment, and adverse effects. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 11, 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to December week 1, 2016), Embase (to 22 December 2016), PsycINFO (1806 to December week 3, 2016), and the Web of Science (to 22 December 2016) and handsearched the reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of interventions using buprenorphine to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha(2)-adrenergic agonists (clonidine or lofexidine), symptomatic medications or placebo, and different buprenorphine-based regimens. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 27 studies involving 3048 participants. The main comparators were clonidine or lofexidine (14 studies). Six studies compared buprenorphine versus methadone, and seven compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. We assessed 12 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one of seven domains of methodological quality. Six of these studies compared buprenorphine with clonidine or lofexidine and two with methadone; the other four studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction.For the comparison of buprenorphine and methadone in tapered doses, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of intensity of withdrawal or adverse effects. However, information reported by the individual studies was suggestive of buprenorphine and methadone having similar capacity to ameliorate opioid withdrawal, without clinically significant adverse effects. The meta-analyses that were possible support a conclusion of no difference between buprenorphine and methadone in terms of average treatment duration (mean difference (MD) 1.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.11 to 10.72; N = 82; studies = 2; low quality) or treatment completion rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20; N = 457; studies = 5; moderate quality).Relative to clonidine or lofexidine, buprenorphine was associated with a lower average withdrawal score (indicating less severe withdrawal) during the treatment episode, with an effect size that is considered to be small to moderate (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.43, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.28; N = 902; studies = 7; moderate quality). Patients receiving buprenorphine stayed in treatment for longer, with an effect size that is considered to be large (SMD 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; N = 558; studies = 5; moderate quality) and were more likely to complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.06; N = 1264; studies = 12; moderate quality). At the same time there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but dropout due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15; N = 134; studies = 3; low quality). The difference in treatment completion rates translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), indicating that for every four people treated with buprenorphine, we can expect that one additional person will complete treatment than with clonidine or lofexidine.For studies comparing different rates of reduction of the buprenorphine dose, meta-analysis was possible only for treatment completion, with separate analyses for inpatient and outpatient settings. The results were diverse, and we assessed the quality of evidence as being very low. It remains very uncertain what effect the rate of dose taper has on treatment outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or lofexidine for managing opioid withdrawal in terms of severity of withdrawal, duration of withdrawal treatment, and the likelihood of treatment completion.Buprenorphine and methadone appear to be equally effective, but data are limited. It remains possible that the pattern of withdrawal experienced may differ and that withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine.It is not possible to draw any conclusions from the available evidence on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose. The divergent findings of studies included in this review suggest that there may be multiple factors affecting the response to the rate of dose taper. One such factor could be whether or not the initial treatment plan includes a transition to subsequent relapse prevention treatment with naltrexone. Indeed, the use of buprenorphine to support transition to naltrexone treatment is an aspect worthy of further research.Most participants in the studies included in this review were male. None of the studies reported outcomes on the basis of sex, preventing any exploration of differences related to this variable. Consideration of sex as a factor influencing response to withdrawal treatment would be relevant research for selecting the most appropriate type of intervention for each individual.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gowing L ; Ali R ; White JM ; Mbewe D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD002025.pub5 ","Keywords":"Acute Disease\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nClonidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gowing L, Ali R, White JM, and Mbewe D (2017) Buprenorphine for managing opioid withdrawal..

Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) may provide an opportunity to improve access to HCV care. This systematic review assessed the association of OAT and HCV testing, treatment, and treatment outcomes among PWID. METHODS: Bibliographic databases and conference presentations were searched for studies that assessed the association between OAT and HCV testing, treatment, and treatment outcomes (direct-acting antiviral [DAA] therapy only) among PWID (in the past year). Meta-analysis was used to pool estimates. RESULTS: Of 9877 articles identified, 22 studies conducted in Australia, Europe, North America, and Thailand were eligible and included. Risk of bias was serious in 21 studies and moderate in 1 study. Current/recent OAT was associated with an increased odds of recent HCV antibody testing (4 studies; odds ratio (OR), 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-2.39), HCV RNA testing among those who were HCV antibody-positive (2 studies; OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.27-2.62), and DAA treatment uptake among those who were HCV RNA-positive (7 studies; OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.20). There was insufficient evidence of an association between OAT and treatment completion (9 studies) or sustained virologic response following DAA therapy (9 studies). CONCLUSIONS: OAT can increase linkage to HCV care, including uptake of HCV testing and treatment among PWID. This supports the scale-up of OAT as part of strategies to enhance HCV treatment to further HCV elimination efforts.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Grebely J ; Tran L ; Degenhardt L ; Dowell-Day A ; Santo T ; Larney S ; Hickman M ; Vickerman P ; French C ; Butler K ; Gibbs D ; Valerio H ; Read P ; Dore GJ ; Hajarizadeh B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/cid/ciaa612 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid\r\nAntiviral Agents/therapeutic use\r\nAustralia/epidemiology\r\nEurope\r\n*Hepatitis C/drug therapy\r\n*Hepatitis C, Chronic/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nNorth America\r\n*Pharmaceutical Preparations\r\n*Substance Abuse, Intravenous/complications/drug therapy\r\nThailand\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nHCV\r\nIDU\r\nPWID\r\ncare cascade\r\ninjecting drug use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Grebely J, Tran L, Degenhardt L, Dowell-Day A, Santo T, Larney S, Hickman M, Vickerman P, French C, Butler K, Gibbs D, Valerio H, Read P, Dore GJ, and Hajarizadeh B (2021) Association Between Opioid Agonist Therapy and Testing, Treatment Uptake, and Treatment Outcomes for Hepatitis C Infection Among People Who Inject Drugs: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis..

In the United States, updated legislation in 2021 entitled, \"The Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder\", released by the Department of Health and Human Services, creates an exemption for the previously required Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA) waiver for buprenorphine prescribing for clinicians. This legislation was born out of a need for making MOUD more accessible for patients living with OUD as rates of opioid-related deaths in the United States have continued to rise and have increased disproportionately during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation has the potential to improve access to MOUD across all geographic locations, but may have the most profound impact in rural areas where significant disparities and challenges still exist in patients' ability to access buprenorphine. The purpose of this literature review is to 1) examine how MOUD prescribing has changed after previous legislation changes, 2) explore the current state of buprenorphine access for treatment of OUD in rural America, 3) detail existing barriers in patients' ability to access MOUD, and 4) discuss future directions and considerations as a result of new legislation. This literature review found several existing barriers to receiving MOUD such as increasing costs, insufficient education, significant stigma, and the need for more innovative methods of delivery. We also found that there is currently a large opportunity for growth in the number of rural clinicians able to prescribe buprenorphine, particularly in primary care, that may now occur as a result of this new legislation. Overall, this legislation has the potential to have a positive impact on combating OUD, especially in rural areas, and may be a critical step towards ending the current opioid epidemic in the United States as these described barriers are addressed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gregory HM ; Hill VM ; Parker RW ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.7759/cureus.19870 ","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ndea waiver\r\nmedication assisted treatment (mat)\r\nmedications for opioid use disorder (moud)\r\nnaloxone\r\nopioid agonist\r\nopioid medication\r\nopioid use disorder (oud)\r\nrural health\r\nsuboxone","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gregory HM, Hill VM, and Parker RW (2021) Implications of Increased Access to Buprenorphine for Medical Providers in Rural Areas: A Review of the Literature and Future Directions..

Materials and Methods: The authors systematically searched seven databases and websites for peer-reviewed and gray literature related to telehealth solutions for buprenorphine treatment published between 2008 and March 18, 2021. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for articles that met the inclusion criteria, according to the scoping review study protocol. The authors included studies if they specifically examined telehealth interventions aimed at improving access to and usage of buprenorphine for OUD. Results: After screening 371 records, the authors selected 69 for full review. These studies examined the effect of telehealth on patient satisfaction, treatment retention rates, and buprenorphine accessibility and adherence. Conclusion: According to the reviewed literature, incorporation of telehealth technology with medication-assisted treatment for OUD is associated with higher patient satisfaction, comparable rates of retention, an overall reduction in health care costs, and an increase in both access to and usage of buprenorphine. This has been made possible through the expansion of telehealth technologies and a substantial push toward relaxed federal guidelines, both of which were quickly escalated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research is needed to fully quantify the effect of these factors; however, the results appear promising thus far and should urge policymakers to consider making these temporary policy changes permanent.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guillen AG ; Reddy M ; Saadat S ; Chakravarthy B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1089/tmj.2021.0308 ","Keywords":"*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPandemics\r\n*Telemedicine/methods\r\n*COVID-19 Drug Treatment\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nopioid use disorder\r\ntelehealth\r\ntelemedicine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guillen AG, Reddy M, Saadat S, and Chakravarthy B (2022) Utilization of Telehealth Solutions for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder Using Buprenorphine: A Scoping Review..

Service integration is one strategy identified to support increased access. We reviewed and synthesized literature exploring client and provider experiences of integrated opioid substitution therapy and HIV care to identify acceptable approaches to care delivery. We systematically reviewed qualitative literature. We searched nine bibliographic databases, supplemented by manual searches of reference lists of articles from the database search, relevant journals, conferences, key organizations and consultation with experts. Thematic synthesis was used to develop descriptive themes in client and provider experiences. The search yielded 11 articles for inclusion, along with 8 expert and policy reports. We identify five descriptive themes: the convenience and comprehensive nature of co-located care, contrasting care philosophies and their role in shaping integration, the limits to disclosure and communication between clients and providers, opioid substitution therapy enabling HIV care access and engagement, and health system challenges to delivering integrated services. The discussion explores how integrated opioid substitution therapy and HIV care needs to adapt to specific social conditions, rather than following universal approaches. We identify priorities for future research. Acceptable integrated opioid substitution therapy and HIV care for people who use drugs and providers is most likely through co-located care and relies upon attention to stigma, supportive relationships and client centred cultures of delivery. Further research is needed to understand experiences of integrated care, particularly delivery in low and middle income settings and models of care focused on community and non-clinic based delivery.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Guise A ; Seguin M ; Mburu G ; McLean S ; Grenfell P ; Islam Z ; Filippovych S ; Assan H ; Low A ; Vickerman P ; Rhodes T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/09540121.2017.1300634 ","Keywords":"Anti-Retroviral Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nDelivery of Health Care/organization & administration\r\nHIV Infections/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nHumans\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nPreventive Health Services/*organization & administration\r\nPrimary Health Care/*methods\r\nSocial Stigma\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nART\r\nHIV\r\nOST\r\nPeople who inject drugs\r\nintegration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Guise A, Seguin M, Mburu G, McLean S, Grenfell P, Islam Z, Filippovych S, Assan H, Low A, Vickerman P, and Rhodes T (2017) Integrated opioid substitution therapy and HIV care: a qualitative systematic review and synthesis of client and provider experiences..

METHODS: After a 2-day, blinded, fixed-dose induction with BNX-RDT (5.7/1.4 mg and 5.7/1.4 or 11.4/2.8 mg, respectively) or buprenorphine (8 mg and 8 or 16 mg, respectively), patients received open-label titrated doses of BNX-RDT or BNX film (generic buprenorphine induction group) during days 3 to 14. On day 15, patients switched treatment (using a conversion ratio of 5.7-8 mg) and continued switched treatment through day 22. Assessments included treatment retention, opioid withdrawal (Clinical and Subjective Opiate Withdrawal scales), opioid cravings (0-100 visual analog scale [VAS]), and preference ratings. RESULTS: Of the 287 patients who switched from BNX-RDT to BNX film and 279 patients who switched from BNX film to BNX-RDT at day 15, 8.7% and 6.1% withdrew, respectively. Reductions in opioid withdrawal and cravings were similar with both formulations through day 15; after switching treatment, reductions were maintained through day 22 in both groups. Preference ratings at day 22 (patients had received both formulations) favored BNX-RDT for taste, mouthfeel, ease of administration, and overall preference (all P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In both patient groups who switched treatment at day 15, more than 90% were retained in treatment, and reductions in opioid withdrawal and cravings were sustained. A significant majority of patients preferred BNX-RDT over BNX film, the clinical impact of which requires further study.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gunderson EW ; Sumner M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000201 ","Keywords":"Administration, Sublingual\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/*administration & dosage/adverse \r\n      effects/*therapeutic use\r\nCraving/drug effects\r\n*Dosage Forms\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nPatient Preference\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gunderson EW, and Sumner M (2016) Efficacy of Buprenorphine/Naloxone Rapidly Dissolving Sublingual Tablets (BNX-RDT) After Switching From BNX Sublingual Film..

A-CHESS is an evidence-based smartphone intervention shown to improve addiction-related behaviors. The authors tested the efficacy of MOUD alone versus MOUD plus A-CHESS to determine whether the combination further improved outcomes. METHODS: In an unblinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 414 participants recruited from outpatient programs were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either MOUD alone or MOUD+A-CHESS for 16 months and were followed for an additional 8 months. All participants were on methadone, buprenorphine, or injectable naltrexone. The primary outcome was abstinence from illicit opioid use; secondary outcomes were treatment retention, health services use, other substance use, and quality of life; moderators were MOUD type, gender, withdrawal symptom severity, pain severity, and loneliness. Data sources were surveys comprising multiple validated scales, as well as urine screens, every 4 months. RESULTS: There was no difference in abstinence between participants in the MOUD+A-CHESS and MOUD-alone arms across time (odds ratio=1.10, 95% CI=0.90-1.33). However, abstinence was moderated by withdrawal symptom severity (odds ratio=0.95, 95% CI=0.91-1.00) and MOUD type (odds ratio=0.57, 95% CI=0.34-0.97). Among participants without withdrawal symptoms, abstinence rates were higher over time for those in the MOUD+A-CHESS arm than for those in the MOUD-alone arm (odds ratio=1.30, 95% CI=1.01-1.67). Among participants taking methadone, those in the MOUD+A-CHESS arm were more likely to be abstinent over time (b=0.28, SE=0.09) than those in the MOUD-alone arm (b=0.06, SE=0.08), although the two groups did not differ significantly from each other (∆b=0.22, SE=0.11). MOUD+A-CHESS was also associated with greater meeting attendance (odds ratio=1.25, 95% CI=1.05-1.49) and decreased emergency department and urgent care use (odds ratio=0.88, 95% CI=0.78-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MOUD+A-CHESS did not improve abstinence relative to MOUD alone. However, MOUD+A-CHESS may provide benefits for subsets of patients and may impact treatment utilization.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gustafson DH ; Landucci G ; Vjorn OJ ; Gicquelais RE ; Goldberg SB ; Johnston DC ; Curtin JJ ; Bailey GL ; Shah DV ; Pe-Romashko K ; Gustafson DH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.20230055 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nQuality of Life\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\n*Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/etiology\r\n*Telemedicine\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nMedications for Opioid Use Disorder\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid Use Disorder\r\nSubstance-Related and Addictive Disorders\r\nmHealth","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gustafson DH, Landucci G, Vjorn OJ, Gicquelais RE, Goldberg SB, Johnston DC, Curtin JJ, Bailey GL, Shah DV, Pe-Romashko K, and Gustafson DH (2024) Effects of Bundling Medication for Opioid Use Disorder With an mHealth Intervention Targeting Addiction: A Randomized Clinical Trial..

This secondary analysis study investigated treatment preference, retention, and relapse rates amongst a subgroup of 73 Black participants with OUD (81% male, mean age 39.05, SD = 11.80) participating in a 24-week multisite randomized clinical trial (\"X:BOT\") comparing the effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) between 2014 and 2017. Chi-square analyses were used to investigate treatment preference assessed at baseline, and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate differences in the odds of retention and relapse assessed over the 24-week course of treatment between treatment groups. Our findings suggest no differences in preference for XR-NTX versus BUP-NX. However, similar to the parent trial, there was an induction hurdle such that only 59.5% of those randomized to XR-NTX successfully initiated medication compared to 91.6% of those randomized to BUP-NX (OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.52).

Clinical trials testing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors among depressed patients on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) failed to show efficacy, whereas those on tricyclic antidepressants produced mixed results with potential for cardiotoxicity. Desvenlafaxine (DESV) is a SNRI with minimal cardiotoxicity and drug interactions. This study sought to assess feasibility and tolerability of using DESV in depressed patients on MMT. A total of 18 depressed individuals on MMT received DESV (50-100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Participants were assessed for the following: (a) Safety of DESV using Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events-GI, ECG [corrected Q-T (QTc) interval measurement] and methadone serum levels; (b) depressive symptoms using Montgomery-Äsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); and (c) other outcomes including anxiety, suicidality, craving, substance use, quality of life, and other depression scales. Registration number on ClinicalTrials. gov is NCT02200406. Among participants who completed the study, MADRS scores significantly decreased at week 8 compared with baseline. Responders and remitters on MADRS at week 8 were 61 and 50%, respectively. There was no significant change in [corrected Q-T (QTc) interval measurement] between baseline and week 4. DESV was well tolerated and associated with improvement of depressive symptoms. DESV may be a promising contender to treat depression in individuals on MMT and deserves further exploration in a randomized double-blinded clinical trial.","Comments":"2018-08-16","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hage C E; Ghabrash M F; Dubreucq S ; Brissette S ; Lespérance F ; Lespérance P ; Ouellet-Plamondon C ; Bruneau J ; Jutras-Aswad D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YIC.0000000000000223","Keywords":"NCT02200406\r\nantidepressant agent\r\ndesvenlafaxine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nserotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor\r\nadult\r\naged\r\nanxiety\r\nanxiety disorder\r\narticle\r\ncardiotoxicity\r\nclinical article\r\nClinical Global Impression scale\r\nColumbia suicide severity rating scale\r\nconstipation\r\ndepression\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\ndrug urine level\r\nelectrocardiogram\r\nfatigue\r\nfemale\r\nHamilton Anxiety Scale\r\nheadache\r\nHeroin Craving Questionnaire\r\nhuman\r\nmajor depression\r\nmale\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nMontgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale\r\nnausea\r\nopen study\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcomes research\r\npatient compliance\r\npilot study\r\npreliminary data\r\npriority journal\r\npsychological rating scale\r\nQT interval\r\nquality of life\r\nquestionnaire\r\nself report\r\nStructured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders\r\nsuicidal ideation\r\nsymptom\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nvomiting\r\npristiq","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hage C E, Ghabrash M F, Dubreucq S, Brissette S, Lespérance F, Lespérance P, Ouellet-Plamondon C, Bruneau J, and Jutras-Aswad D (2018) A pilot, open-label, 8-week study evaluating desvenlafaxine for treatment of major depression in methadone-maintained individuals with opioid use disorder.

This systematic review assessed DAA treatment outcomes among people with recent drug use and those receiving opioid substitution therapy. METHODS: Bibliographic databases and conference presentations were searched for observational studies and clinical trials assessing DAA treatment completion, sustained virological response (SVR), and loss to follow-up among people with recent drug use (injecting or non-injecting) and those receiving opioid substitution therapy. Meta-analysis was used to pool estimates and meta-regression to explore heterogeneity. FINDINGS: 38 eligible studies, with 3634 participants, were included. The definition of recent drug use varied across studies, with drug use in the past 6 months and at the initiation of or during DAA therapy most commonly used. Among individuals with recent injecting or non-injecting drug use (21 studies; 1408 participants), treatment completion was 97·5% (95% CI 96·6-98·3) and SVR was 87·7% (95% CI 84·2-91·3). Among individuals receiving opioid substitution therapy (36 studies; 2987 participants), treatment completion was 97·4% (95% CI 96·5-98·3) and SVR was 90·7% (95% CI 88·5-93·0). Among individuals with recent injecting drug use (eight studies; 670 participants), treatment completion was 96·9% (95% CI 95·6-98·2) and SVR was 87·4% (95% CI 82·0-92·8). In meta-regression analysis, clinical trials (vs observational studies; adjusted odd ratio 2·18, 95% CI 1·27-3·75; p=0·006) and higher mean or median age (1·07, 1·02-1·12; p=0·008) were significantly associated with higher SVR. Clinical trials (0·45, 0·22-0·94; p=0·033) and older age (0·94, 0·88-0·99; p=0·034) were also significantly associated with a lower proportion of participants lost to follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Response to DAA therapy was favourable among people with recent drug use (including those who inject) and those receiving opioid substitution therapy, supporting broadening access in these populations.

This systematic review assessed the rate of HCV reinfection following treatment among people with recent drug use and those receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT). METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases and conference abstracts for studies assessing post-treatment HCV reinfection rates among people with recent drug use (injecting or non-injecting) or those receiving OAT. Meta-analysis was used to cumulate reinfection rates and meta-regression was used to explore heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies were included (6,311 person-years of follow-up). The overall rate of HCV reinfection was 5.9/100 person-years (95% CI 4.1-8.5) among people with recent drug use (injecting or non-injecting), 6.2/100 person-years (95% CI 4.3-9.0) among people recently injecting drugs, and 3.8/100 person-years (95% CI 2.5-5.8) among those receiving OAT. Reinfection rates were comparable following interferon-based (5.4/100 person-years; 95% CI 3.1-9.5) and direct-acting antiviral (3.9/100 person-years; 95% CI 2.5-5.9) therapy. In stratified analysis, reinfection rates were 1.4/100 person-years (95% CI 0.8-2.6) among people receiving OAT with no recent drug use, 5.9/100 person-years (95% CI 4.0-8.6) among people receiving OAT with recent drug use, and 6.6/100 person-years (95% CI 3.4-12.7) among people with recent drug use not receiving OAT. In meta-regression analysis, longer follow-up was associated with lower reinfection rate (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] per year increase in mean/median follow-up 0.77; 95% CI 0.69-0.86). Compared with people receiving OAT with no recent drug use, those with recent drug use receiving OAT (aRR 3.50; 95% CI 1.62-7.53), and those with recent drug use not receiving OAT (aRR 3.96; 95% CI 1.82-8.59) had higher reinfection rates. CONCLUSION: HCV reinfection risk following treatment was higher among people with recent drug use and lower among those receiving OAT. The lower rates of reinfection observed in studies with longer follow-up suggested higher reinfection risk early post-treatment. LAY SUMMARY: Our findings demonstrate that although reinfection by hepatitis C virus occurs following successful treatment in people with recent drug use, the rate of hepatitis C reinfection is lower than the rates of primary infection reported in the literature for this population - reinfection should not be used as a reason to withhold therapy from people with ongoing injecting drug use. The rate of hepatitis C reinfection was lowest among people receiving opioid agonist therapy with no recent drug use. These data illustrate that harm reduction services are required to reduce the reinfection risk, while regular post-treatment hepatitis C assessment is required for early detection and retreatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hajarizadeh B ; Cunningham EB ; Valerio H ; Martinello M ; Law M ; Janjua NZ ; Midgard H ; Dalgard O ; Dillon J ; Hickman M ; Bruneau J ; Dore GJ ; Grebely J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhep.2019.11.012 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nAntiviral Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\n*Hepacivirus\r\nHepatitis C, Chronic/*complications/*drug therapy/virology\r\nHumans\r\nIncidence\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*complications/drug therapy\r\nReinfection/*epidemiology/virology\r\nRisk\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*complications\r\nSustained Virologic Response\r\nDAA\r\nFollow-up\r\nHCV\r\nMeta-regression\r\nOAT\r\nOpioid agonist therapy\r\nPWID\r\nReinfection\r\nSVR\r\nSustained virological response\r\nSystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hajarizadeh B, Cunningham EB, Valerio H, Martinello M, Law M, Janjua NZ, Midgard H, Dalgard O, Dillon J, Hickman M, Bruneau J, Dore GJ, and Grebely J (2020) Hepatitis C reinfection after successful antiviral treatment among people who inject drugs: A meta-analysis..

Thematic analysis of the barriers to OST was undertaken to determine barrier themes and subthemes. Results: There were 37 studies included in the review; 18 were qualitative, 15 were quantitative and four were mixed methods. The barrier themes identified were stigma and fear, regulatory, logistical, attitudinal and social factors. Within these barrier themes 19 barrier subthemes were identified. The most reported OST barrier subthemes were negative treatment perceptions, cost, stigma and lack of flexibility. Conclusion: This review discusses important barriers to OST and examines reported barriers from the client perspective. OST guidelines and programs would benefit by introducing programs that reduce stigma, increase treatment knowledge and health literacy, reduce treatment costs, increase treatment flexibility and allow for easier treatment access.","Comments":"2021-08-13","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hall N Y; Le L ; Majmudar I ; Mihalopoulos C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108651","Keywords":"methadone\r\nattitude to health\r\nclinical practice\r\nDSM-IV\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nhealth care access\r\nhealth care cost\r\nhealth care disparity\r\nhealth literacy\r\nhealth program\r\nhuman\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npatient attitude\r\npractice guideline\r\nqualitative analysis\r\nquantitative analysis\r\nreview\r\nself report\r\nsocial aspect\r\nsocial stigma\r\nsystematic review\r\nthematic analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hall N Y, Le L, Majmudar I, and Mihalopoulos C (2021) Barriers to accessing opioid substitution treatment for opioid use disorder: A systematic review from the client perspective.

Increasing the range of therapeutic options optimizes outcomes and facilitates patient management. An international, multi-center, two-phase study investigated the efficacy and safety of slow-release oral morphine (SROM) versus methadone in patients receiving methadone therapy for opioid dependence. In phase 1 (two way cross-over, 11 weeks each period) patients were randomized to SROM or methadone oral solution. In phase 2 (25 weeks), patients continued treatment with SROM (group A) or switched from methadone to SROM (group B). In total, 211 out of 276 completed phase 1 and 198 entered phase 2 (n=95 group A, n=103 group B). Treatment with both SROM and methadone was well tolerated. However, the mean QTc-interval associated with methadone was significantly longer than that under SROM. Higher treatment satisfaction, fewer cravings for heroin, and lower mental stress were reported with SROM. This study adds a significant further weight of evidence that SROM is an effective and well tolerated long-term maintenance treatment for opioid dependence with a beneficial risk profile compared to methadone regarding cardiac effects and supports its clinical utility.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hämmig R ; Köhler W ; Bonorden-Kleij K ; Weber B ; Lebentrau K ; Berthel T ; Babic-Hohnjec L ; Vollmert C ; Höpner D ; Gholami N ; Verthein U ; Haasen C ; Reimer J ; Ruckes C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2014.05.012 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nCross-Over Studies\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nEurope\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInternational Cooperation\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nMorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nOpioid dependence\r\nOpioid substitution treatment\r\nQTc-interval\r\nSafety\r\nSlow-release oral morphine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hämmig R, Köhler W, Bonorden-Kleij K, Weber B, Lebentrau K, Berthel T, Babic-Hohnjec L, Vollmert C, Höpner D, Gholami N, Verthein U, Haasen C, Reimer J, and Ruckes C (2014) Safety and tolerability of slow-release oral morphine versus methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence..

Given retention challenges during transmucosal buprenorphine (BUP-TM) induction, assessing methods to quickly achieve sustained buprenorphine concentrations is important. Objectives: This open-label, single-group, single-center pilot study (NCT03993392) evaluated safety and tolerability of initiating BUP-XR following a single BUP-TM 4 mg dose. Methods: Eligible participants abstained from short and long-acting opioids for 6 and 24 hours, respectively. If the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) was ≥8, BUP-TM 4 mg was administered. Participants not exhibiting hypersensitivity, precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW), or sedation symptoms within 1 hour received BUP-XR 300 mg (assessed as inpatients for 48 hours and outpatients to Day 29). Endpoints were COWS score increase ≥6, independent adjudication of POW, and opioid use. Results: Twenty-six participants (14 male) received BUP-TM, 24 received BUP-XR, and 20 completed the study. After injection, COWS scores decreased from pre-BUP-TM baseline of 14.6 ± 4.1 to 6.9 ± 4.1 at 6 hours and 4.2 ± 3.2 at 24 hours. Most participants (62.5%) experienced maximum COWS scores pre-BUP-XR; 2 experienced a COWS score increase ≥6, occurring at 1 and 2 hours post-BUP-XR. By adjudication, 2/24 participants experienced POW. Irritability, anxiety, nausea, and pain were the most frequent adverse events (AEs) with no serious AEs. Conclusions: Results support increased flexibility for initiating BUP-XR. Initiating BUP-XR 300 mg following a single BUP-TM 4 mg dose was well tolerated. Although some participants initially experienced withdrawal symptoms after injection, significant symptomatic improvement was observed in all participants within 24 hours.","Comments":"2023-03-13","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hassman H ; Strafford S ; Shinde S N; Heath A ; Boyett B ; Dobbins R L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2022.2106574","Keywords":"NCT03993392\r\nNCT04060654\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncannabinoid\r\nclonidine\r\nfentanyl\r\nibuprofen\r\nondansetron\r\noxycodone\r\ntrazodone\r\nadult\r\nanxiety disorder\r\narticle\r\nchill\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical assessment\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndemographics\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nDSM-5\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\ninjection site contusion\r\ninjection site pain\r\ninsomnia\r\nirritability\r\nmale\r\nnausea\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain\r\npilot study\r\nsingle drug dose\r\nsustained drug release\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nvisual analog scale\r\nvomiting\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hassman H, Strafford S, Shinde S N, Heath A, Boyett B, and Dobbins R L (2023) Open-label, rapid initiation pilot study for extended-release buprenorphine subcutaneous injection.

Emergent disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupt already-strained harm reduction efforts and treatment availability. This study aims to answer three research questions. How do public health emergencies impact PWOUD? How can health systems respond to novel public health emergencies to serve PWOUD? How can the results of this scoping review be contextualized to the province of Alberta to inform local stakeholder responses to the pandemic? METHODS: We conducted a scoping review using the 6-stage Arksey and O'Malley framework to analyse early-pandemic and pre-pandemic disaster literature. The results of the scoping review were contextualized to the local pandemic response, through a Nominal Group Technique (NGT) process with frontline providers and stakeholders in Alberta, Canada. RESULTS: Sixty one scientific journal articles and 72 grey literature resources were included after full-text screening. Forty sources pertained to early COVID-19 responses, and 21 focused on OUD treatment during other disasters. PWOUD may be more impacted than the general population by common COVID-19 stressors including loss of income, isolation, lack of rewarding activities, housing instability, as well as fear and anxiety. They may also face unique challenges including threats to drug supplies, stigma, difficulty accessing clean substance use supplies, and closure of substance use treatment centres. All of these impacts put PWOUD at risk of negative outcomes including fatal overdose. Two NGT groups were held. One group (n = 7) represented voices from urban services, and the other (n = 4) Indigenous contexts. Stakeholders suggested that simultaneous attention to multiple crises, with adequate resources to allow attention to both social and health systems issues, can prepare a system to serve PWOUD during disasters. CONCLUSION: This scoping review and NGT study uncovers how disasters impact PWOUD and offers suggestions for better serving PWOUD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Henderson R ; McInnes A ; Mackey L ; Bruised Head M; Crowshoe L ; Hann J ; Hayward J ; Holroyd BR ; Lang E ; Larson B ; Leonard AJ ; Persaud S ; Raghavji K ; Sarin C ; Virani H ; Wadsworth IW ; Whitman S ; McLane P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12889-021-11495-0 ","Keywords":"Alberta\r\n*COVID-19\r\n*Disasters\r\nEmergencies\r\nHumans\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/epidemiology/therapy\r\nPandemics/prevention & control\r\nPublic Health\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nCoronavirus\r\nDisaster planning\r\nEmergency\r\nHealth services\r\nMedication assisted treatment\r\nOpioid agonist treatment\r\nOpioid epidemic\r\nReview","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Henderson R, McInnes A, Mackey L, Bruised Head M, Crowshoe L, Hann J, Hayward J, Holroyd BR, Lang E, Larson B, Leonard AJ, Persaud S, Raghavji K, Sarin C, Virani H, Wadsworth IW, Whitman S, and McLane P (2021) Opioid use disorder treatment disruptions during the early COVID-19 pandemic and other emergent disasters: a scoping review addressing dual public health emergencies..

Methods: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, CINHAL, and PsychINFO, databases. All studies that provided a ratio of those retained in treatment at a specified time in terms of gender and/or race/ethnicity and medication were included. Variables were created to assess the effects of time in treatment, recruited sample, required attendance at concurrent psychosocial treatment, and adherence to strict rules of conduct for continuation in treatment on retention. Meta-analytical and meta-regression methods were used to compare studies on the ratio of those who completed a specific time in treatment by race/ethnicity group and by gender. Results: Nineteen articles that provided the outcome variable of interest were found (11 buprenorphine, six methadone, and two naltrexone). Meta-analyses found that treatment retention was similar for all gender and racial/ethnic groups for all three medications. Meta-regression found that those of the African American group who were recruited into buprenorphine treatment were retained significantly longer than African Americans in buprenorphine treatment who were studied retrospectively. Also, both genders had significantly lower retention in methadone treatment when there was the additional requirement of psychosocial therapy.","Comments":"2021-10-05","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hochheimer M ; Unick G J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107113","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nAfrican American\r\ncultural factor\r\ndrug dependence treatment\r\nethnicity\r\ngender\r\nhuman\r\nmedication compliance\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\noutcome variable\r\npatient counseling\r\npsychosocial intervention\r\nrace\r\nretention in care\r\nreview\r\nsex difference\r\nsocial aspect\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment duration\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hochheimer M, and Unick G J (2022) Systematic review and meta-analysis of retention in treatment using medications for opioid use disorder by medication, race/ethnicity, and gender in the United States.

Guidelines recommend supervised self-administration for at least 3 months, yet this is often interpreted as long-term supervision. However, there is no evidence base for deciding the optimal period of supervision. We tested the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of different supervision models. DESIGN AND METHODS: Three armed pilot RCT, set in three Scottish treatment areas, recruited opiate-dependent patients who had received methadone treatment for 3 months. Participants were randomised to: (i) no supervision; (ii) twice weekly supervision; or (iii) daily supervision for further 3 months. As a pilot, key process measures were: recruitment rates, follow-up rates and treatment fidelity. We also wanted to estimate effect sizes of two co-primary outcomes for a full RCT: treatment retention and illicit heroin use. The recruitment target was 60 participants. RESULTS: One hundred and two eligible patients were identified, 60 (59%) participated, and 46 followed up (77%). Study fidelity was good with two participants moving group. Those randomised to no supervision were significantly happier with their group allocation. No significant differences were found in primary outcomes, although retention decreased with increased supervision, while illicit heroin use was least in those most supervised. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to recruit and randomise participants to an RCT comparing different forms of supervised consumption. Pilot data suggest increased supervision may reduce illicit heroin use, but may decrease retention. This should now be tested in a large-scale multicentre RCT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holland R ; Matheson C ; Anthony G ; Roberts K ; Priyardarshi S ; Macrae A ; Whitelaw E ; Appavoo S ; Bond C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1465-3362.2011.00394.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Medication Adherence\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nPilot Projects\r\nScotland\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holland R, Matheson C, Anthony G, Roberts K, Priyardarshi S, Macrae A, Whitelaw E, Appavoo S, and Bond C (2012) A pilot randomised controlled trial of brief versus twice weekly versus standard supervised consumption in patients on opiate maintenance treatment..

We aimed to determine whether supervised consumption of OMT improved retention and other measures of drug use. DESIGN: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing 3 months of daily supervised consumption of OMT with 1 month or less of daily supervised OMT, then daily unsupervised consumption. SETTING: Four community drug services in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 293 opioid-dependent patients entering OMT. PRIMARY OUTCOME: retention in treatment at 12 weeks. Secondary: retention at 6 months; illicit drug use [Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP)]; quality of life (SF-12 and MAP); criminality (MAP); and social functioning. FINDINGS: No significant between-group difference was observed for the primary outcome: 69% (100 of 145) supervised and 74% (109 of 148) unsupervised were retained [odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.43-1.27]. Per protocol survival analysis suggested that supervised patients were less well retained (hazard ratio for retention = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.51-1.00). Illicit opioid use reduced in both groups and, while not statistically significant by intention-to-treat analysis, favoured unsupervised patients in per protocol analysis (odds of positive opioid screen for supervised versus unsupervised = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.05-4.06). Data on criminal activity also favoured unsupervised patients with 21% supervised patients committing crime versus 9% unsupervised (OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.28-8.86). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a difference in treatment retention or opioid use rates between patients whose consumption of opioid maintenance treatment was supervised for 3 months daily (except Saturdays) compared with supervision for 1 month. There was some evidence that longer periods of supervised consumption were associated with higher levels of criminality.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Holland R ; Maskrey V ; Swift L ; Notley C ; Robinson A ; Nagar J ; Gale T ; Kouimtsidis C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.12439 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nCrime/statistics & numerical data\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMaintenance Chemotherapy\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods/psychology\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nProportional Hazards Models\r\nQuality of Life/psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nBuprenorphine\r\ncapability index\r\nconsumption\r\ncriminality\r\nillicit drug use\r\nopiate maintenance treatment\r\nquality of life\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsupervised methadone\r\ntreatment retention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Holland R, Maskrey V, Swift L, Notley C, Robinson A, Nagar J, Gale T, and Kouimtsidis C (2014) Treatment retention, drug use and social functioning outcomes in those receiving 3 months versus 1 month of supervised opioid maintenance treatment.

The aim of this study was to apply and test if a contingency management (or motivational incentives) intervention can improve treatment retention and reduce drug use. DESIGN: Random assignment to usual care with (n = 160) or without (n = 159) incentives during a 12-week trial. Incentives participants earned draws for a chance to win prizes on two separate tracks targeting opiate-negative urine sample or consecutive attendance; the number of draws increased with continuous abstinence or attendance. SETTING: Community-based methadone maintenance clinics in Shanghai and Kunming. PARTICIPANTS: The sample was 23.8% female, mean age was 38, mean years of drug use was 9.4 and 57.8% had injected drugs in the past 30 days. MEASUREMENTS: Treatment retention and negative drug urine. FINDINGS: Relative to the treatment-as-usual (control) group, better retention was observed among the incentive group in Kunming (75% versus 44%), but no difference was found in Shanghai (90% versus 86%). Submission of negative urine samples was more common among the incentive group than the usual care (74% versus 68% in Shanghai, 27% versus 18% in Kunming), as was the longest duration of sustained abstinence (7.7 weeks versus 6.5 in Shanghai, 2.5 versus 1.6 in Kunming). The average total prize amount was 371 Yuan (or $55) per participant (527 for Shanghai versus 216 in Kunming).

DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: This secondary analysis included 1267 opioid-dependent individuals participating in nine opioid treatment programs between 2006 and 2009 and randomized to receive open-label BUP or MET for 24 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The analyses included measures of patient characteristics at baseline (demographics; use of alcohol, cigarettes and illicit drugs; self-rated mental and physical health), medication dose and urine drug screens during treatment, and treatment completion and days in treatment during the 24-week trial. FINDINGS: The treatment completion rate was 74% for MET versus 46% for BUP (P < 0.01); the rate among MET participants increased to 80% when the maximum MET dose reached or exceeded 60 mg/day. With BUP, the completion rate increased linearly with higher doses, reaching 60% with doses of 30-32 mg/day. Of those remaining in treatment, positive opioid urine results were significantly lower [odds ratio (OR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.52-0.76, P < 0.01] among BUP relative to MET participants during the first 9 weeks of treatment. Higher medication dose was related to lower opiate use, more so among BUP patients. A Cox proportional hazards model revealed factors associated with dropout: (i) BUP [versus MET, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.61, CI = 1.20-2.15], (ii) lower medication dose (<16 mg for BUP, <60 mg for MET; HR = 3.09, CI = 2.19-4.37), (iii) the interaction of dose and treatment condition (those with higher BUP dose were 1.04 times more likely to drop out than those with lower MET dose, and (iv) being younger, Hispanic and using heroin or other substances during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of methadone appears to be associated with better retention in treatment for opioid dependence than buprenorphine, as does use of provision of higher doses of both medications. Provision of buprenorphine is associated with lower continued use of illicit opioids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hser YI ; Saxon AJ ; Huang D ; Hasson A ; Thomas C ; Hillhouse M ; Jacobs P ; Teruya C ; McLaughlin P ; Wiest K ; Cohen A ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.12333 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaloxone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate dependence\r\ntreatment outcomes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hser YI, Saxon AJ, Huang D, Hasson A, Thomas C, Hillhouse M, Jacobs P, Teruya C, McLaughlin P, Wiest K, Cohen A, and Ling W (2014) Treatment retention among patients randomized to buprenorphine/naloxone compared to methadone in a multi-site trial..

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Follow-up was conducted in 2011-14 of 1080 opioid-dependent participants entering seven opioid treatment programs in the United States between 2006 and 2009 and randomized (within each program) to receive open-label buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone for up to 24 weeks; 795 participants completed in-person interviews (~74% follow-up interview rate) covering on average 4.5 years. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were indicated by mortality and opioid use. Covariates included demographics, site, cocaine use and treatment experiences. FINDINGS: Mortality was not different between the two randomized conditions, with 23 (3.6%) of 630 participants randomized to buprenorphine having died versus 26 (5.8%) of 450 participants randomized to methadone. Opioid use at follow-up was higher among participants randomized to buprenorphine relative to methadone [42.8 versus 31.7% positive opioid urine specimens, P < 0.01, effect size (h) = 0.23 (0.09, 0.38); 5.8 days versus 4.4 days of past 30-day heroin use, P < 0.05, effect size (d) = 0.14 (0.00, 0.28)]. Opioid use during the follow-up period by randomization condition was also significant (F(7,39,600) = 3.16; P < 0.001) due mainly to less treatment participation among participants randomized to buprenorphine than methadone. Less opioid use was associated with both buprenorphine and methadone treatment (relative to no treatment); no difference was found between the two treatments. Individuals who are white or used cocaine at baseline responded better to methadone than to buprenorphine. CONCLUSIONS: There are few differences in long-term outcomes between buprenorphine and methadone treatment for opioid dependence, and treatment with each medication is associated with a strong reduction in opioid use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hser YI ; Evans E ; Huang D ; Weiss R ; Saxon A ; Carroll KM ; Woody G ; Liu D ; Wakim P ; Matthews AG ; Hatch-Maillette M ; Jelstrom E ; Wiest K ; McLaughlin P ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13238 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nRandom Allocation\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nlongitudinal\r\nmethadone\r\nmortality\r\nopioid dependence\r\nopioid use\r\noutcomes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hser YI, Evans E, Huang D, Weiss R, Saxon A, Carroll KM, Woody G, Liu D, Wakim P, Matthews AG, Hatch-Maillette M, Jelstrom E, Wiest K, McLaughlin P, and Ling W (2016) Long-term outcomes after randomization to buprenorphine/naloxone versus methadone in a multi-site trial..

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In a randomized controlled trial, adults with OUD were randomized to 24 weeks of either BUP or MET treatment and were followed up in 3-yearly assessments. The present secondary analyses were based on 597 participants who completed all assessments. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome measure was the number of days of using opioids per month during the follow-up period. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to classify participants into three groups: life-time mood disorder (n = 302), life-time mental disorder other than mood disorder (n = 114) and no mental disorder (n = 181). Medication treatment (BUP, MET, no treatment) during the follow-up period was a time-varying predictor. FINDINGS: Based on zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) mixed regression analysis, it was found that relative to no treatment, opioid use during the follow-up was significantly reduced by BUP [odds ratio (OR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.07-0.21 for any use; risk ratio (RR) = 0.77, 95% CI =0.66-0.89 for days of use] and by MET [OR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.25-0.45 for any use; RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.72-0.84 for days of use]. Relative to MET, BUP was associated with a lower likelihood of any opioid use among participants with mood disorders (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74) and for participants without mental disorder (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.21-0.66) and fewer number of days using opioids (RR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.25-0.56) among participants with other mental disorders.

Women and men might have clinically meaningful differences in their experience in OUD treatment and might also have unique challenges in achieving successful, long-term recovery. This review summarizes and synthesizes the current literature on sex-based differences in OUD treatment outcomes. Methods: Relevant literature was identified via automated and manual searches using the terms “opioid treatment outcome sex [or gender] differences” and “opiate treatment outcome sex [or gender] differences.” Search methodology was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and were conducted within the PubMed electronic database during March and April of 2018. Results: The initial PubMed search yielded 241 manuscripts and 31 original research articles that met inclusion/exclusion criteria were synthesized in this review. Several important trends emerged, including findings that women are more likely than men to present to treatment with co-occurring mental health conditions such as depression, and that women might respond particularly well to buprenorphine maintenance. Discussion and Conclusions: While much of the literature on this topic is subject to potential cohort effects, interventions that address co-occurring mental health conditions and psychosocial stress might improve treatment outcomes for women with OUD. Scientific Significance: Funding agencies and researchers should focus attention toward human laboratory studies and clinical trials that are prospectively designed to assess sex-based differences in OUD recovery.

This study examined whether a dual-orexin receptor antagonist would improve sleep and withdrawal outcomes when compared with placebo during a buprenorphine/naloxone taper. Thirty-eight participants with opioid use disorder were recruited to a clinical research unit and maintained on 8/2 to 16/4 mg of buprenorphine/ naloxone treatment for 3 days before being randomized to 20 mg of suvorexant (n = 14), 40 mg of suvorexant (n = 12), or placebo (n = 12); 26 individuals completed the study. After randomization, participants underwent a 4-day buprenorphine/naloxone taper and 4-day post-taper observation period. Total sleep time (TST) was collected nightly with a wireless electroencephalography device and wrist-worn actigraphy; opioid withdrawal symptoms were assessed via the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS); and abuse potential was assessed on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale of “High” every morning. A priori outcomes included two-group (collapsing suvorexant doses versus placebo) and three-group comparisons of area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores for TST, SOWS, and High. In two-group comparisons, participants receiving suvorexant displayed increased TST during the buprenorphine/naloxone taper and decreased SOWS during the post-taper period. In three-group comparisons, participants receiving 20 mg of suvorexant versus placebo displayed increased AUC for TST during the buprenorphine/naloxone taper, but there was no difference in SOWS among groups. There was no evidence of abuse potential in two- or three-group analyses. The results suggest that suvorexant might be a promising treatment for sleep and opioid withdrawal in individuals undergoing a buprenorphine/naloxone taper.","Comments":"2023-01-17","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Huhn A S; Finan P H; Gamaldo C E; Hammond A S; Umbricht A ; Bergeria C L; Strain E C; Dunn K E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1126/scitranslmed.abn8238","Keywords":"buprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nopiate\r\nplacebo\r\nsuvorexant\r\nactimetry\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug dose reduction\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nelectroencephalography\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nintention to treat analysis\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nsleep disorder\r\nsleep time\r\nvisual analog scale\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Huhn A S, Finan P H, Gamaldo C E, Hammond A S, Umbricht A, Bergeria C L, Strain E C, and Dunn K E (2022) Suvorexant ameliorated sleep disturbance, opioid withdrawal, and craving during a buprenorphine taper.

Sustained-release preparations may overcome this limitation. OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and efficacy of a single-treatment sustained-release naltrexone implant with daily oral naltrexone treatment. DESIGN: Seventy heroin-dependent volunteers entered a randomized, double-blind, double-placebo controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up period. PATIENTS: Eligibility criteria were DSM-IV opioid (heroin) dependence; age 18 years or older; willingness to be randomized; residing in the Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan area; and completion of preclinical screening and written consent. A total of 129 eligible participants were identified, and 70 (54%) provided informed consent and were randomized as per the study design. INTERVENTION: Participants received oral naltrexone, 50 mg/d, for 6 months (plus placebo implants) or a single dose of 2.3 g of naltrexone implant (plus placebo tablets). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Maintaining therapeutic naltrexone levels above 2 ng/mL; (2) return to regular heroin use (>or=4 d/wk); (3) other heroin use and abstinence; (4) use of illicit nonopioid drugs; (5) number of opiate overdoses requiring hospitalization; (6) treatment-related unexpected and expected adverse events; and (7) blood naltrexone levels (ie, pharmacokinetic profile) for recipients of active naltrexone implants. RESULTS: More participants in the oral vs the implant group had blood naltrexone levels below 2 ng/mL in months 1 (P < .001) and 2 (P = .01); in addition, more oral group participants had returned to regular heroin use by 6 months (P = .003) and at an earlier stage (median [SE], 115 [12.0] days vs 158 [9.4] days). There were 10 trial-related, unexpected adverse events. One serious adverse event, a wound hematoma, was associated with surgical implantation. Naltrexone blood levels in implant recipients were maintained above 1 and 2 ng/mL for 101 (95% confidence interval, 83-119) and 56 (39-73) days, respectively, among men and 124 (88-175) and 43 (16-79) days among women. CONCLUSIONS: The naltrexone implant effectively reduced relapse to regular heroin use compared with oral naltrexone and was not associated with major adverse events.

INTERVENTIONS: Subjects stabilized on 650 mg of dextropropoxyphene for 5 days were randomly divided into two groups on the sixth day: group A (n=25) received 20 mg of memantine with buprenorphineplacebo, and group B (n=20) received 2 mg of buprenorphine with memantine placebo. Acute withdrawals were precipitated with naloxone (0.4 mg, intravenously) and were assessed using subjective and objective opioid withdrawal scales (SOWS and OOWS) and two separate visual analogue scales (VASs) for pain and dysphoria at baseline prior to test drug administration and again after the precipitation of acute withdrawal. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severity ofprecipitated opioid withdrawals. RESULTS: Baseline opioid withdrawal symptoms in both groups did not differ significantly. After the precipitation of acute withdrawal, there were no significant differences between subjects in both groups on OOWS and both VASs but showed significant difference on SOWS. When changes in ratings from baseline (and after naloxone-precipitated acute withdrawal) were compared between the two groups, a significant difference in the change in SOWS scores was observed with greater decrease in withdrawal scores in the buprenorphine group.

There are various therapies in the domain of addiction whose main purposes are to reduce or to cut down substance abuse. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of group spiritual intervention on selfesteem and happiness among male clients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment. METHODS: This study was an intervention study in which 60 clients affected with substance abuse and undergoing methadone maintenance treatment were recruited. The study samples were selected through convenience sampling method and then divided randomly into two groups of 30 individuals: intervention and control. The intervention group attended group spiritual interventions for 10 sessions. Self-esteem and happiness among the study participants were also measured through Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The results showed a significant difference between both intervention and control groups in terms of self-esteem and happiness (P < 0.05); so that the participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in their self-esteem and happiness. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that group spiritual intervention as a useful method could be effective in enhancing self-esteem and happiness among addicted individuals undergoing methadone maintenance treatment. The given treatment could be also used as a complementary therapy beside methadone maintenance treatment to reduce the likelihood of people returning to substance abuse.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jalali A ; Behrouzi MK ; Salari N ; Bazrafshan MR ; Rahmati M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/1874473711666180510164420 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Happiness\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*psychology\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/psychology/rehabilitation/*therapy\r\nPersonal Satisfaction\r\nPsychotherapy, Group/*methods\r\n*Self Concept\r\n*Spirituality\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nHappiness\r\ndrug user\r\nmale\r\nmethadone maintenance therapy\r\nself-esteem\r\nspiritual intervention.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jalali A, Behrouzi MK, Salari N, Bazrafshan MR, and Rahmati M (2019) The Effectiveness of Group Spiritual Intervention on Self-esteem and Happiness Among Men Undergoing Methadone Maintenance Treatment..

In many high-income countries, needle and syringe exchange programs (NSPs) have been associated with reductions in bloodborne infections. However, there is not a good understanding of the effectiveness of NSP in low- and middle-income countries and transitional-economy countries. A systematic literature review, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was utilized to collect primary study data on the coverage of NSP programs and the changes in HIV and HCV infection over time among PWID in lowand middle-income and transitional countries (LMICs). We included studies that reported laboratory measures of HIV or HCV and at least 50% coverage of the local injecting population (either through direct use or through secondary exchange). We also included national reports of newly reported HIV cases in countries that had national level data for PWID in conjunction with NSP scale-up and NSP implementation. Included in the review were studies of 11 NSPs with high-coverage from Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Estonia, Iran, Lithuania, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. In five studies, the HIV prevalence decreased (ranged from 3% to 15%) and in three studies the HCV prevalence decreased (ranged from 4.2% to 10.2%). In two studies, the HIV prevalence increased (ranged from 5.6% to 14.8%). The HCV incidence remained stable in one study. Of the four national reports of newly reported HIV cases, three studies reported decreases during the expansion of the NSP, and ranged from 30% to 93.3%; however, one national report documented an increase in HIV cases (37.6%). The estimated incidence among new injectors decreased in three studies with the reductions ranging from 11/100 person-years at risk to 16/100 person-years at risk. The data, although not fully consistent, generally support the effectiveness of NSP in reducing HIV and HCV infection in LMICs. If high coverage is achieved, NSP appears to be as effective in LMICs as in high-income countries. To identify and correct contributing problems, additional monitoring and evaluation research is needed for NSPs in which reductions in HIV/HCV infection among PWID are not occurring.

We addressed the following questions: (1) how successful is induction on XR-NTX; (2) what are adherence rates to XR-NTX; and (3) does XR-NTX decrease opioid use? Factors associated with these outcomes as well as overdose rates were examined. METHODS: We searched PubMed and used Google Scholar for forward citation searches of peer-reviewed papers from January 2006 to June 2017. Studies that included individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder who were offered XR-NTX were included. RESULTS: We identified and included 34 studies. Pooled estimates showed that XR-NTX induction success was lower in studies that included individuals that required opioid detoxification [62.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.5-70.0%] compared with studies that included individuals already detoxified from opioids (85.0%, 95% CI = 78.0-90.1%); 44.2% (95% CI = 33.1-55.9%) of individuals took all scheduled injections of XR-NTX, which were usually six or fewer. Adherence was higher in prospective investigational studies (i.e. studies conducted in a research context according to a study protocol) compared to retrospective studies of medical records taken from routine care (6-month rates: 46.7%, 95% CI = 34.5-59.2% versus 10.5%, 95% CI = 4.6-22.4%, respectively). Compared with referral to treatment, XR-NTX reduced opioid use in adults under criminal justice supervision and when administered to inmates before release. XR-NTX reduced opioid use compared with placebo in Russian adults, but this effect was confounded by differential retention between study groups. XR-NTX showed similar efficacy to buprenorphine when randomization occurred after detoxification, but was inferior to buprenorphine when randomization occurred prior to detoxification. CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals intending to start extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) do not and most who do start XR-NTX discontinue treatment prematurely, two factors that limit its clinical utility significantly. XR-NTX appears to decrease opioid use but there are few experimental demonstrations of this effect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jarvis BP ; Holtyn AF ; Subramaniam S ; Tompkins DA ; Oga EA ; Bigelow GE ; Silverman K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.14180 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/poisoning\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDrug Overdose\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nExtended-release\r\nheroin\r\ninjectable\r\nmedication-assisted treatment\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopioid use disorder\r\nprescription opioids","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jarvis BP, Holtyn AF, Subramaniam S, Tompkins DA, Oga EA, Bigelow GE, and Silverman K (2018) Extended-release injectable naltrexone for opioid use disorder: a systematic review..

DESIGN: Randomized 2 × 2 single-site controlled trial conducted from November 2012 through May 2016. After a detoxification and oral naltrexone induction, participants were assigned to a Usual Care, Abstinence Incentives, XR-NTX, or XR-NTX plus Abstinence Incentives group for a six-month intervention period. SETTING: A model therapeutic workplace where participants could work on automated computer programs that targeted job-skills training for 4 h every weekday for 24 weeks and earn about $10 per hour. PARTICIPANTS: 84 heroin-dependent adults who were unemployed and medically approved for naltrexone. Most participants were male (71.4%), African American (80.1%), and cocaine dependent (71.4%). MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was the percentage of urine samples negative for opiates that were collected at once weekly assessments (24 per participant) that were not part of the intervention and for which participants were paid $10 for completing. INTERVENTION: Participants who attended the workplace provided thrice-weekly urine samples. Abstinence Incentives participants had to provide opiate-free urine samples to maintain maximum pay. XR-NTX participants received one injection every 4 weeks and were required to take injections in order to work and to maintain maximum pay. Usual Care participants were not offered XR-NTX and opiate urinalysis results did not affect pay. FINDINGS: A large percentage (65 of 149; 43.6%) of individuals failed the induction protocol required for randomization and to be eligible to receive XR-NTX. When missing urine samples were considered positive, there was no significant interaction between XR-NTX and Abstinence Incentives. XR-NTX plus Abstinence Incentives participants provided significantly more opiate-negative samples (81.3%, SD 39.0%) than XR-NTX participants (64.5%, SD 47.9%; aOR 10.4, 95% CI 1.3-85.5; P = .030). When urine samples were not replaced, there was a significant interaction between XR-NTX and Abstinence Incentives (aOR 77.0, 95% CI 1.3-4432;P = 0.036); XR-NTX plus Abstinence Incentives participants provided significantly more opiate-negative samples (99.6%, SD 0.1%) than XR-NTX participants (85.0%, SD 35.7%; aOR 147.6, 95% CI 6.3-3472; P = 0.002), Abstinence Incentives participants (91.9%, SD 27.3%; aOR 121.7, 95% CI 4.8-3067; P =0.004), and Usual Care participants (78.7%, SD 41.0%; aOR 233.4, 95% CI 9.4-5814; P <.001). No other group differences were significant. CONCLUSION: XR-NTX plus incentives for opiate abstinence increased opiate abstinence, but XR-NTX alone did not. XR-NTX can promote opiate abstinence when it is combined with incentives for opiate abstinence in a model therapeutic workplace.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jarvis BP ; Holtyn AF ; DeFulio A ; Koffarnus MN ; Leoutsakos JS ; Umbricht A ; Fingerhood M ; Bigelow GE ; Silverman K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.12.026 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBlack or African American/psychology\r\nCocaine/*urine\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin/*urine\r\nHumans\r\nInjections\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMotivation\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/ethnology/psychology\r\nSubstance Abuse Detection\r\nWorkplace\r\nContingency management\r\nEmployment-based reinforcement\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nHeroin\r\nIncentives\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nTherapeutic workplace\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jarvis BP, Holtyn AF, DeFulio A, Koffarnus MN, Leoutsakos JS, Umbricht A, Fingerhood M, Bigelow GE, and Silverman K (2019) The effects of extended-release injectable naltrexone and incentives for opiate abstinence in heroin-dependent adults in a model therapeutic workplace: A randomized trial..

All other studies were uncontrolled. Retention rates were good (from 80.6 to 95%) with SROM maintenance, but similar retention rates were obtained with methadone. Most of the studies showed that quality of life, withdrawal symptoms, craving and additional drug consumption improved with SROM. However, there was no comparison with other maintenance drugs. As most of the studies assessing SROM efficacy were uncontrolled, there is no definite evidence that SROM is an effective alternative to methadone for OMT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jegu J ; Gallini A ; Soler P ; Montastruc JL ; Lapeyre-Mestre M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.03923.x ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*rehabilitation\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy/*rehabilitation\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jegu J, Gallini A, Soler P, Montastruc JL, and Lapeyre-Mestre M (2011) Slow-release oral morphine for opioid maintenance treatment: a systematic review..

Most of these are prescribed for coping with chronic pain. The coexistence of opioid use disorder (OUD) in patients with chronic pain represents a complex challenge due to the need for managing both pain and OUD. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of feasible treatments for this population with OUD and comorbid chronic pain for both conditions. A systematic database search has been performed using Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and ClinicalTrials.gov in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. Eligible articles addressed the outcomes in chronic pain patients with comorbid opioid use disorder after treatment interventions were applied. Of 593 identified articles, nine were eligible for qualitative review (n = 7 pharmacological interventions; n = 2 psychological interventions). Methadone, buprenorphine, cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness showed promising results, but data were inconclusive (<2 RCT with low risk of bias). It is unclear whether the opioid agonist treatment should be maintained or tapered and which drug should be prescribed for the opioid substitution therapy (methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone). Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy have a discrete effect on improving negative affect but not pain. The therapeutic approach might be individualized under a shared decision-making basis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jiménez-Fernández B ; Calomarde-Gómez C ; López-Lazcano A ; Lligoña A ; Gual A ; López-Pelayo H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.20882/adicciones.1680 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Chronic Pain/complications/drug therapy\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/complications/epidemiology/therapy\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use/adverse effects\r\nMethadone\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/methods","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jiménez-Fernández B, Calomarde-Gómez C, López-Lazcano A, Lligoña A, Gual A, and López-Pelayo H (2023) Systematic review on the clinical management of chronic pain and comorbid opioid use disorder..

Its focus is on an assessment of the comparative effectiveness of methadone and buprenorphine pharmacotherapy, with particular attention given to recent findings from the literature. Recommendations for clinical practice are outlined, and directions for future research are presented. Findings from comparative studies of methadone and buprenorphine underscore the efficacy of both medications in preventing relapse to illicit opioid use in the treatment of opioid-dependent pregnant patients, as well as the simplicity of induction onto methadone and patient retention while receiving such therapy. Fetal monitoring suggests that buprenorphine results in less fetal cardiac and movement suppression than does methadone. The clinical implications of these findings need future exploration. For the neonate, evidence from studies using a wide range of designs, including retrospective chart reviews, prospective observational studies, and randomized clinical trials, show consistent results, with prenatal exposure to buprenorphine resulting in less severe neonatal abstinence syndrome relative to methadone. Any medication given to pregnant women should be prescribed only after considering the risk : benefit ratio for the maternal-fetal dyad. Medication choices for each opioid-dependent patient during pregnancy need to be made on a patient-by-patient basis, taking into consideration the patient's opioid dependence history, previous and current treatment experiences, medical circumstances and treatment preferences. Moreover, for a full remission of opioid addiction to be sustainable, both post-partum and across the lifespan, treatment providers must not rely solely on medication to treat their patients but should also utilize women-specific comprehensive treatment models that address the underlying multifaceted complexities of their patient's lives.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jones HE ; Finnegan LP ; Kaltenbach K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2165/11632820-000000000-00000 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jones HE, Finnegan LP, and Kaltenbach K (2012) Methadone and buprenorphine for the management of opioid dependence in pregnancy..

METHODS: Within each outcome area, findings are summarized first for the three randomized clinical trials and then for the 44 non-randomized studies (i.e. prospective studies, case reports and series and retrospective chart reviews), only 28 of which involve independent samples. RESULTS: Results indicate that maternal treatment with buprenorphine has comparable efficacy to methadone, although difficulties may exist with current buprenorphine induction methods. The available fetal data suggest buprenorphine results in less physiological suppression of fetal heart rate and movements than methadone. Regarding neonatal effects, perhaps the single definitive conclusion is that prenatal buprenorphine treatment results in a clinically significant less severe neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) than treatment with methadone. The limited research suggests that, like methadone, buprenorphine is compatible with breastfeeding. Data available thus far suggest that there are no deleterious effects of in utero buprenorphine exposure on infant development. CONCLUSIONS: While buprenorphine produces a less severe neonatal abstinence syndrome than methadone, both methadone and buprenorphine are important parts of a complete comprehensive treatment approach for opioid-dependent pregnant women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jones HE ; Heil SH ; Baewert A ; Arria AM ; Kaltenbach K ; Martin PR ; Coyle MG ; Selby P ; Stine SM ; Fischer G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.04035.x ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nChild Development/drug effects\r\nFemale\r\nFetus/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nLength of Stay\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nMilk, Human/chemistry\r\nMorphine/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/drug therapy\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/urine\r\nPain Management/methods\r\nPatient Dropouts\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/therapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\n*Substance Abuse Detection\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jones HE, Heil SH, Baewert A, Arria AM, Kaltenbach K, Martin PR, Coyle MG, Selby P, Stine SM, and Fischer G (2012) Buprenorphine treatment of opioid-dependent pregnant women: a comprehensive review..

However, concerns regarding its extramedical use and diversion, such as adverse patient outcomes and damage to the legitimacy of addictions practice, are persistent. The aim of this review is to synthesize the perspectives and experiences of health care providers around the extramedical use of buprenorphine. METHODS: A qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted based on a systematic search of 8 databases. All primary qualitative and mixed-methods studies relating to the views of health care providers on the extramedical use of buprenorphine were included. A qualitative analysis informed by the constant comparative method was conducted, using NVivo for data management. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in this review. Findings were organizedunder 2 key themes: (1) Harm-producing versus harm-reducing effects of extramedical buprenorphine use and (2) driving forces of and responses to extramedical buprenorphine use. CONCLUSIONS: The studies included in our review identified a disconnect-health care providers noted that macro, health care system-level challenges drove extramedical use whereas the recommended solutions for prevention and management were primarily aimed at the micro, individual level.

The aim of the present study was the longitudinal investigation of HRQOL in patients with severe opioid dependence, who were randomly assigned to four groups of medical and psychosocial treatment: heroin (diacetylmorphine) versus methadone and case management (CM) versus psychoeducation (PSE) respectively. METHODS: HRQOL (MSQoL) and physical health (OTI) were investigated in 938 subjects, who participated in the German multi-centre study examining the effects of heroin-assisted treatment in patients with severe opioid dependence. Data for the present analysis were taken from baseline and 12-month follow up. RESULTS: Under both forms of maintenance and psychosocial treatment HRQOL improved significantly during the observation period. HRQOL improvement under maintenance with heroin exceeded improvement under methadone, especially with regard to subjective physical health. HRQOL improvement was significantly associated with better expert-rated physical health. Further analyses showed significant better improvement of HRQOL in subjects treated with PSE compared with CM. CONCLUSIONS: The advantage of heroin with regard to the improvement of HRQOL may be partially explained by a better improvement of physical health under maintenance with heroin compared with methadone, which highlights the importance of a comprehensive model of health care for patients with severe opioid dependence. Future studies need to investigate the benefits of PSE for patients in maintenance therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Karow A ; Reimer J ; Schäfer I ; Krausz M ; Haasen C ; Verthein U ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.06.009 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAged, 80 and over\r\nCase Management\r\nCounseling\r\nEducation\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin/*therapeutic use\r\nHeroin Dependence/drug therapy/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nInterview, Psychological\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Karow A, Reimer J, Schäfer I, Krausz M, Haasen C, and Verthein U (2010) Quality of life under maintenance treatment with heroin versus methadone in patients with opioid dependence..

Genetic factors contribute to individual differences in opioid response; however, little is known regarding genetic associations with clinical outcomes in people receiving opioid agonist therapies. Participants diagnosed with opioid use disorder, principally consisting of prescription opioids (licit or illicit), were randomized to methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone for 24 weeks of daily treatment (NCT03033732). Urine was collected at 12 biweekly study visits and analyzed for non-treatment opioids. Variants in genes involved in methadone metabolism (CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4), buprenorphine metabolism (CYP3A4 and UGT2B7), and μ-opioid receptor function (OPRM1) were genotyped and analyzed for their association with the number of non-treatment opioid-free urine screens. Primary analyses focused on the last 12 weeks (6 study visits, post-titration) of treatment among those reporting White ethnicity. Additional sensitivity and exploratory analyses were performed. Among methadone-treated participants (n = 52), the OPRM1 rs1799971 AA genotype (vs. G-genotypes, i.e., having one or two G alleles) was associated with greater opioid-free urine screens (incidence rate ratio = 5.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.43-11.26, P = 0.000023); longitudinal analyses showed a significant genotype-by-time interaction over the full 24 weeks (12 study visits, β = -0.28, 95% CI = -0.45 to -0.11, P = 0.0015). Exploratory analyses suggest an OPRM1 rs1799971 genotype effect on retention. No evidence of association was found between other genetic variants, including in metabolic variants, and non-treatment opioid-free urine screens in the methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone arms. Those with the OPRM1 rs1799971 G-genotypes may have a poorer response to methadone maintenance treatment, an effect that persisted through 24 weeks of treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kazi I ; Chenoweth MJ ; Jutras-Aswad D ; Ahamad K ; Socias ME ; Le Foll B ; Tyndale RF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/cpt.3112 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\nPharmacogenetics\r\nCytochrome P-450 CYP3A\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/adverse effects\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/genetics\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kazi I, Chenoweth MJ, Jutras-Aswad D, Ahamad K, Socias ME, Le Foll B, and Tyndale RF (2024) Pharmacogenetics of Biochemically Verified Abstinence in an Opioid Agonist Therapy Randomized Clinical Trial of Methadone and Buprenorphine/Naloxone..

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to determine what factors were associated with longer retention in buprenorphine treatment. DESIGN: We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in February 2018. Articles were restricted to randomized controlled trials on human subjects, written in English, which contained ≥ 24 weeks of objective data on retention in buprenorphine treatment. MAIN MEASURES: We assessed whether dose of buprenorphine, treatment setting, or co-administration of behavioral therapy was associated with retention rates. KEY RESULTS: Over 14,000 articles were identified. Thirteen articles (describing 9 studies) met inclusion criteria. Measures of retention varied widely. Three studies compared doses of buprenorphine between 1 and 8 mg and showed significantly higher rates of retention with higher doses (p values < 0.01). All other studies utilized buprenorphine doses between 8 and 24 mg daily, without comparison. No study found a significant difference in retention between buprenorphine alone and buprenorphine plus behavioral therapy (p values > 0.05). Initiating buprenorphine while hospitalized or within criminal justice settings prior to outpatient treatment programs was significantly associated with retention in buprenorphine treatment (p values < 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Setting of treatment initiation and a higher buprenorphine dose are associated with improved long-term treatment retention. More objective data on buprenorphine treatment programs are needed, including a standardized approach to defining retention in buprenorphine treatment programs.

Addicted individuals have an intense focus on using substances. This study aimed to investigate the effect of adding memantine to clonidine and buprenorphine in reducing withdrawal symptoms, compared with placebo, in drug-dependent patients (opium and heroin). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial study, 60 patients using opium or heroin were assigned to the intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 30) groups. Both groups were treated with buprenorphine and clonidine at the same dose in the detoxification process. The intervention group received memantine 10 mg daily for 10 days and then 20 mg daily for 21 days, and the control group received a placebo prepared in the same shape and size as memantine tablets. The severity of withdrawal symptoms was measured using the Short Opioid Withdrawal Scale over 3 weeks. Data analysis was performed using SPSS and descriptive and inferential tests. RESULTS: The results showed that despite memantine's superiority in controlling some withdrawal symptoms such as feeling sick, stomach pain, muscle spasm, and feeling cold, no significant difference was found between the 2 groups. There was also no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the total score of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: No specific advantage of memantine was found for reducing the symptoms of withdrawal syndrome in the present study. However, this drug was well tolerated without any evidence of serious or significant adverse effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kheirabadi G ; Najafian N ; Khodadadi F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JCP.0000000000001466 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nAdult\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nClonidine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMemantine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy\r\nOutcome Assessment, Health Care\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kheirabadi G, Najafian N, and Khodadadi F (2021) The Effect of Adding Memantine to Clonidine in Reducing Withdrawal Symptoms in Opioid-Dependent Patients: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial..

LTI was modeled on interim methadone maintenance to transition SEP admissions to the structure of medication-assisted treatment while maximizing exposure to methadone pharmacotherapy. VRI used monetary incentives to reinforce adherence to pharmacotherapy and adaptive counseling. SCI participants received standard methadone dosing and adaptive counseling. All participants were stabilized on methadone pharmacotherapy with a target dose of 80 mg. Following the initiation phase, participants in each condition received standard adaptive counseling from months 4-6. Results showed that most participants failed to achieve the target methadone dose. While no condition differences were observed in retention rates over the 3-month and 6-month observation periods, participants across conditions exhibited reductions in objective and self-report measures of drug use.

There is a gap in literature on the impact of opium tincture (OT) on patients' QoL compared to standard treatment options such as methadone. This study aimed to compare the QoL of participants with opioid use disorder receiving OAT using OT or methadone and identify the factors associated with their QoL during treatment. METHODS: The opium trial was a multicenter non-inferiority randomized clinical trial in four private OAT outpatient clinics in Iran. The study assigned patients to either OT (10 mg/ml) or methadone sirup (5 mg/ml) for a follow-up of 85 days. QoL was assessed using the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL- BREF). RESULTS: A total of 83 participants, 35 (42.2%) in the OT arm and 48 (57.8%) in the methadone arm, completed the WHOQOL-BREF in full and were included in the primary analysis. The mean score of patients' QoL showed improvement compared to baseline, but differences were not statistically significant between OT and methadone arms (p = 0.786). Improvements were mainly observed within the first 30 days of receiving treatment. Being married and lower psychological distress were associated with an improved QoL. Within the social relationships domain, male gender showed significantly higher QoL compared to females. CONCLUSION: OT shows promise as an OAT medication, comparable to methadone in improving patients' QoL. There is a need to incorporate psychosocial interventions to further sustain and improve the QoL in this population. Identifying other social determinants of health which affect QoL and the cultural adaptation of assessments for individuals from various ethnocultural backgrounds are critical areas of inquiry.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kim JJ ; Nikoo M ; Nikoo N ; Javidanbardan S ; Kazemi A ; Choi F ; Gholami A ; Lafooraki NY ; Vogel M ; Rezazadeh-Azar P ; Meyer M ; Cabanis M ; Jang K ; Aknondzadeh S ; Krausz M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.110874 ","Keywords":"Female\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Methadone/therapeutic use\r\nOpium/therapeutic use\r\nQuality of Life/psychology\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/psychology\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/psychology\r\nIran\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid agonist treatment\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nOpium tincture\r\nQuality of life","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kim JJ, Nikoo M, Nikoo N, Javidanbardan S, Kazemi A, Choi F, Gholami A, Lafooraki NY, Vogel M, Rezazadeh-Azar P, Meyer M, Cabanis M, Jang K, Aknondzadeh S, and Krausz M (2023) Quality of life of patients treated with opium tincture or methadone: A randomized controlled trial..

Opioid substitution is recommended, but whether methadone or buprenorphine is the optimal agent remains unclear. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Open Gray, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to April 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing methadone and buprenorphine treatment for opioid-using mothers. Included studies assessed maternal and or neonatal outcomes. We used random-effects meta-analyses to estimate summary measures for outcomes and report these separately for RCTs and cohort studies. RESULTS: Of 408 abstracts screened, 20 papers were included (4 RCTs, 16 cohort, 223 and 7028 participants respectively). All RCTs (4/4) had a high risk of bias and median (IQR) Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies was 7.5 (6-9). In both RCTs and cohort studies, buprenorphine was associated with; greater offspring birth weight (weighted mean difference [WMD] 343 g (95% CI: 40-645 g) in RCT and 184 g (95% CI: 121-247 g) in cohort studies); body length at birth (WMD 2.28 cm (95% CI: 1.06-3.49 cm) in RCTs and 0.65 cm (95% CI: 0.31-0.98 cm) in cohort studies); and reduced risk of prematurity (risk ratio [RR] 0.41 (95% CI: 0.18-0.93) in RCTs and 0.63 [95% CI: 0.53-0.75] in cohort studies) when compared to methadone. All other clinical outcomes were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to methadone, buprenorphine was consistently associated with improved birthweight and gestational age, however given potential biases, results should be interpreted with caution.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kinsella M ; Halliday LOE ; Shaw M ; Capel Y ; Nelson SM ; Kearns RJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10826084.2022.2083174 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nChild\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nPregnancy\r\nMethadone\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nopioid replacement\r\npregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kinsella M, Halliday LOE, Shaw M, Capel Y, Nelson SM, and Kearns RJ (2022) Buprenorphine Compared with Methadone in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis..

Therefore, ED management often entails symptomatic control. The purpose of this study was to compare olanzapine to clonidine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing 10 mg of IM olanzapine to 0.3 mg of oral clonidine for symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Adult (18 years and older) ED patients reporting a history of opioid use and symptoms consistent with withdrawal were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had already received treatment during the ED encounter, were pregnant, incarcerated, or unable to provide consent. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive olanzapine or clonidine for their initial treatment. A baseline Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score was calculated. After 30 min, the patient could receive any additional treatment at the ED physician's discretion. The primary outcome was need for additional medication (rescue) within 1 h of study medication administration. Secondary outcomes included change in COWS score and adverse reactions. Results: We enrolled 63 patients (33 olanzapine, 30 clonidine). Demographic characteristics were similar for both groups (median age 45, range 21-67, 54% male) as well as baseline COWS score (median score 11). The median time since last opiate use was 48 h for both groups (range 4-116). Rescue was given within 1 h for olanzapine for 9 (27%) patients and for clonidine in 19 (63%) patients (difference 36%, 95% CI 13-59%). Decrease in COWS score at 1 h was 8.3 for olanzapine and 5.1 for clonidine (difference 3.2, 95% CI 0.3-6). Adverse events were uncommon: akathisia (1, olanzapine), hypotension (2, clonidine), respiratory depression (0). Conclusions: Treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms with 10 mg of IM olanzapine results in a lower incidence of rescue medication administration and improved symptoms (COWS score) compared to 0.3 mg of oral clonidine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Klein LR ; Cole JB ; Driver BE ; Miner JR ; Laes JR ; Fagerstrom E ; L Martel M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15563650.2018.1547828 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nClonidine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOlanzapine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nProspective Studies\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/*prevention & control\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nOlanzapine\r\nclonidine\r\nopioid withdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Klein LR, Cole JB, Driver BE, Miner JR, Laes JR, Fagerstrom E, and L Martel M (2019) An open-label randomized trial of intramuscular olanzapine versus oral clonidine for symptomatic treatment of opioid withdrawal in the emergency department..

This rapid review therefore sought to summarize the retention rates reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled observational study designs that compared methadone to buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone). METHODS: We searched four electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, up to April 2018) for RCTs and controlled observational studies that compared oral fixed-dose methadone to buprenorphine versus methadone (or buprenorphine-naloxone). Data were extracted separately for two different definitions of retention in treatment: (1) length of time retained in the study and (2) presence on the final day of a study. Separate random effects meta-analyses were performed for RCTs and controlled observational studies. Data from controlled observational studies where retention was measured as the length of time retained in the study were not amenable to meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 7603 studies reviewed, 10 RCTs and 3 observational studies met inclusion criteria (n = 5065) and compared fixed-dose oral buprenorphine with methadone. Across studies, the average retention rate was highly variable (RCTs: buprenorphine 20.0-82.5% and methadone 30.7-83.8%; observational studies: buprenorphine 20.2-78.3% and methadone 48.3-74.8%). For time period retained in the study, we observed no significant difference in treatment retention for buprenorphine versus methadone in RCTs (standardized mean difference [SMD] = - 0.07; 95% CI - 0.35-0.21, p = 0.63; quality of evidence: low). For presence on the final study day, we observed no significant difference between buprenorphine and methadone treatment retention in RCTs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.89; 95% CI 0.73-1.08, p = 0.24; quality of evidence: low) and controlled observational studies (RR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.36-1.58, p = 0.45). CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis of existing RCTs suggests retention in oral fixed-dose opioid agonist therapy with methadone appears to be generally equal to buprenorphine (or buprenorphine-naloxone), with wide variation across studies. Similarly, a meta-analysis of three controlled observational studies indicated no difference in treatment retention although there was significant heterogeneity among the included studies. The length of follow-up did not appear to affect the retention rate.

However, OAT programmes are often unavailable or poorly implemented in prisons, in spite of the large numbers of people living with OUDs and the high risk of HIV transmission in prison settings. Unusually, this systematic review synthesizes qualitative evidence relating to barriers to, and facilitators of, the implementation of OAT programmes in prisons in high- and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) to provide more nuanced, contextualised understandings of how prison stakeholders perceive and/or experience OAT programmes within different prison settings. Methods: We systematically reviewed six electronic databases for studies published between January 2005 and December 2019 involving prison stakeholders: policy-makers, governors, healthcare staff, prison officers, and prisoners. The search identified 8091 studies, of which only 16 incorporated qualitative methods (including qualitative elements of mixed methods) and met our quality criteria. Four of these studies were conducted in LMICs (Kyrgyzstan, Iran (2) and Indonesia). Results: Findings were organized under three broad themes: (1) perceived benefits of OAT programmes; (2) barriers to the implementation and development of OAT programmes; and (3) treatment processes. Discussion: A lack of a clear understanding of the roles of OAT programmes and doubts regarding their effectiveness for people living with OUDs in prisons are critical barriers to prisoner participation in both high-and LMIC countries. Prison systems, particularly in LMICs, often lack the resources to mitigate problems with implementation. This review highlights an urgent need to develop further qualitative studies into prison OAT programmes, employing varied methods to explore such contexts in greater depth and minimize the impact of harms relating to OUDs in prisons.","Comments":"2020-11-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Komalasari R ; Wilson S ; Haw S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102978","Keywords":"opiate agonist\r\ndata base\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nhealth care personnel\r\nhealth care policy\r\nhealth program\r\nhuman\r\nIndonesia\r\nIran\r\nKyrgyzstan\r\nmanagement\r\nopiate addiction\r\npersonal experience\r\npriority journal\r\ncorrectional facility\r\nqualitative research\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Komalasari R, Wilson S, and Haw S (2021) A systematic review of qualitative evidence on barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) programmes in PRISONS.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Google, and the references of included studies and relevant guidelines. STUDY SELECTION: Published systematic reviews and newer randomized controlled trials from the past 5 to 10 years that investigated patient-oriented outcomes related to managing OUD in primary care, diagnosis, pharmacotherapies (including buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone), tapering strategies, psychosocial interventions, prescribing practices, and management of comorbidities. SYNTHESIS: From 8626 articles, 39 systematic reviews and an additional 26 randomized controlled trials were included. New meta-analyses were performed where possible. One cohort study suggests 1 case-finding tool might be reasonable to assist with diagnosis (positive likelihood ratio of 10.3). Meta-analysis demonstrated that retention in treatment improves when buprenorphine or methadone are used (64% to 73% vs 22% to 39% for control), when OUD is treated in primary care (86% vs 67% in specialty care, risk ratio [RR] of 1.25, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.47), and when counseling is added to pharmacotherapy (74% vs 62% for controls, RR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36). Retention was also improved with naltrexone (33% vs 25% for controls, RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.64) and reduced with medication-related contingency management (eg, loss of take-home doses as a punitive measure; 68% vs 77% for no contingency, RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: There is reasonable evidence that patients with OUD should be managed in the primary care setting. Diagnostic criteria for OUD remain elusive, with 1 reasonable case-finding tool.

Integration of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) into HIV clinics may increase engagement in the HIV care continuum by decreasing substance use. We aimed to compare (1) XR-NTX treatment initiation, (2) retention and (3) safety of XR-NTX versus treatment as usual (TAU) for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or alcohol use disorder (AUD) in HIV clinics. DESIGN: Non-blinded randomized trial of XR-NTX versus pharmacotherapy TAU. SETTING: HIV primary care clinics in Vancouver, BC, Canada and Chicago, IL, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-one HIV-infected patients seeking treatment for OUD (n = 16), AUD (n = 27) or both OUD and AUD (n = 8). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were XR-NTX initiation (receipt of first injection within 4 weeks of randomization) and retention at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes generated point estimates for change in substance use, HIV viral suppression [HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction (pcr) < 200 copies/ml] and safety. FINDINGS: Two-thirds (68%) of participants assigned to XR-NTX initiated treatment, and 88% of these were retained on XR-NTX at 16 weeks. In comparison, 96% of TAU participants initiated treatment, but only 50% were retained on medication at 16 weeks. Mean days of opioid use in past 30 days decreased from 17.3 to 4.1 for TAU and from 20.3 to 7.7 for XR-NTX. Mean heavy drinking days decreased from 15.6 to 5.7 for TAU and 12.5 to 2.8 for XR-NTX. Among those with OUD, HIV suppression improved from 67 to 80% for XR-NTX and 58 to 75% for TAU. XR-NTX was well tolerated, with no precipitated withdrawals and one serious injection-site reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) is feasible and safe for treatment of opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder in HIV clinics. Treatment initiation appears to be lower and retention greater for XR-NTX compared with treatment as usual (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01908062).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Korthuis PT ; Lum PJ ; Vergara-Rodriguez P ; Ahamad K ; Wood E ; Kunkel LE ; Oden NL ; Lindblad R ; Sorensen JL ; Arenas V ; Ha D ; Mandler RN ; McCarty D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13753 ","Keywords":"Alcoholism/complications/*drug therapy\r\nBritish Columbia\r\nChicago\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHIV Infections/*complications\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy\r\nPilot Projects\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nAlcohol\r\nHIV\r\nextended-release naltrexone\r\ninjection drug use\r\nopioid-related disorders\r\nrandomized clinical trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Korthuis PT, Lum PJ, Vergara-Rodriguez P, Ahamad K, Wood E, Kunkel LE, Oden NL, Lindblad R, Sorensen JL, Arenas V, Ha D, Mandler RN, and McCarty D (2017) Feasibility and safety of extended-release naltrexone treatment of opioid and alcohol use disorder in HIV clinics: a pilot/feasibility randomized trial..

On average, five lives are lost to an opioid overdose every hour of the day; estimated costs associated with opioid misuse exceed $500 billion annually. Illicit opioid discontinuation is the first step in the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), and transition to an opioid agonist may initiate treatment. However, discontinuation to abstinence from either OUD directly or following agonist treatment results in severely distressing opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS). METHODS: This review evaluated studies on the etiology, burden, and management of OWS. RESULTS: Noradrenergic hyperactivity generates many OWS. These OWS can cause patients to relapse during early opioid discontinuation. While agonist therapies are generally first-line for moderate or severe OUD and reduce OWS, prescribing restrictions can limit their availability. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Non-opioid medications to treat OWS provides a gateway into long-term treatment with naltrexone or psychosocial therapies. For opioid dependent patients without OUD, non-opioid treatments like α-2 adrenergic agonists can facilitate opioid tapering. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: For the millions who are physically dependent on opioids, new treatments for OWS can enhance recovery from OUD and prevent relapse. (© 2019 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between illicit opioid use and craving and affect during the evaluation of clonidine as an adjunct medication in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Secondarily, to examine whether those relationships are driven by within- or between-participant factors. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis from our original trial. Participants (N = 108, female: n = 23, male n = 85) receiving buprenorphine were randomized to receive adjunct clonidine or placebo. Participants used portable electronic devices to rate stress, mood, and craving via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) four times randomly each day. To associate the EMA data with illicit opioid use, each EMA report was linked to participants' next urine drug screen (thrice weekly). We used generalized linear mixed models to examine the interaction between treatment group and illicit opioid use, as well as to decompose the analysis into within- and between-participant effects. RESULTS: Craving for opioids and cocaine was increased when participants were using illicit opioids; this effect was greater in the clonidine group. For affect, mood was poorer during periods preceding opioid-positive urines than opioid-negative urines for clonidine-treated participants, whereas there was no difference for placebo participants. CONCLUSION: This secondary analysis provides evidence that for participants maintained on opioid agonist therapy, clonidine minimized the behavioral impact of moderate levels of negative affect and craving.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kowalczyk WJ ; Moran LM ; Bertz JW ; Phillips KA ; Ghitza UE ; Vahabzadeh M ; Lin JL ; Epstein DH ; Preston KL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2018.1454933 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage\r\nAdult\r\nAffect/drug effects\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nClonidine/*administration & dosage\r\nCraving/drug effects\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\n*Ecological Momentary Assessment\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nLinear Models\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nEcological momentary assessment\r\nabstinence\r\nclonidine\r\ncraving\r\nopioid-agonist therapy\r\nstress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kowalczyk WJ, Moran LM, Bertz JW, Phillips KA, Ghitza UE, Vahabzadeh M, Lin JL, Epstein DH, and Preston KL (2018) Using ecological momentary assessment to examine the relationship between craving and affect with opioid use in a clinical trial of clonidine as an adjunct medication to buprenorphine treatment..

Buprenorphine may be more effective than morphine for this indication. METHODS: In this single-site, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial, we randomly assigned 63 term infants (≥37 weeks of gestation) who had been exposed to opioids in utero and who had signs of the neonatal abstinence syndrome to receive either sublingual buprenorphine or oral morphine. Infants with symptoms that were not controlled with the maximum dose of opioid were treated with adjunctive phenobarbital. The primary end point was the duration of treatment for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal. Secondary clinical end points were the length of hospital stay, the percentage of infants who required supplemental treatment with phenobarbital, and safety. RESULTS: The median duration of treatment was significantly shorter with buprenorphine than with morphine (15 days vs. 28 days), as was the median length of hospital stay (21 days vs. 33 days) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Adjunctive phenobarbital was administered in 5 of 33 infants (15%) in the buprenorphine group and in 7 of 30 infants (23%) in the morphine group (P=0.36). Rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants with the neonatal abstinence syndrome, treatment with sublingual buprenorphine resulted in a shorter duration of treatment and shorter length of hospital stay than treatment with oral morphine, with similar rates of adverse events.

To the end of the 6 month course, 43% of patients of group 1, 36% of group 2, 21% of group 3 and 10% of group 4 were in remission. Therefore, N/F was more effective than F/NP (p < 0.01) and FP/NP (p < 0.001); N/FP was more effective than F/NP (p < 0.05) and NP/FP (p < 0.001); F/NP did not differ significantly from NP/FP (p = 0.1); N/F did not differ from N/FP (p = 0.2). However N/F was more effective compared to N/FP only in women, probably, due to the higher baseline levels of depression, anxiety and anhedonia. Naltrexone was superior to placebo and fluoxetine in the efficacy of maintenance of remission and preventing relapse in patients with heroin addiction. The combination of naltrexone and fluoxetine was more effective compared to the monotherapy with naltrexone in women only.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupitskiĭ EM ; Zvartau EE ; Tsoĭ-Podosenin MV ; Masalov DV ; Burakov AM ; Egorova VIu ; Didenko TIu ; Romanova TN ; Ivanova EB ; Bespalov AIu ; Verbitskaia EV ; Neznanov NG ; Grineneko AIa ; O'Brien C ; Woody D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFluoxetine/*therapeutic use\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nPlacebos\r\nRemission Induction\r\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupitskiĭ EM, Zvartau EE, Tsoĭ-Podosenin MV, Masalov DV, Burakov AM, Egorova VIu, Didenko TIu, Romanova TN, Ivanova EB, Bespalov AIu, Verbitskaia EV, Neznanov NG, Grineneko AIa, O'Brien C, and Woody D (2010) [Naltrexone and fluoxetine for maintenance of remission in patients with heroin addiction: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial]..

To study the efficacy and safety of pregabalin (Lyrica) in the complex therapy of opioid withdrawal syndrome (OWS). Materials and methods. The study design was a randomized, symptom-controlled, simple, blind study with active controls. A total of 34 patients with OWS were randomized to two groups. Patients of group 1 (19 subjects) received pregabalin at a dose of up to 600 mg/day as the main substance for treating OWS, in combination with symptomatic treatment (basal and symptom-triggered). Patients of group 2 (15 subjects) received clonidine (Clofelin, up to 600 mg/day) as the main treatment agent, in combination with basal and symptom-triggered treatment. The severity of OWS, cravings for opiates, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and side effects were assessed daily using international validated quantified assessment scales. Results. In group 1, 15 patients (79%) completed OWS treatment, compared with seven (47%) in group 2 (p = 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of the dynamics of the severity of OWS (perhaps because of the limited number of patients). In the pregabalin-treated group, measures of the intensity of opiate cravings decreased during treatment as compared with group 2 (p = 0.05), and similar changes were seen in relation to anxiety (p = 0.05) and depression (p < 0.05); self-assessments of wellbeing increased (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in the overall incidence of side effects, though treatment tolerance was better in group 1. Conclusions. The treatment scheme including pregabalin was effective and safe and was well tolerated by patients, providing more successful completion of detoxification programs.","Comments":"2017-12-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupitskii E M; Ilyuk R D; Mikhailov A D; Kazankov K A; Rybakova K V; Skurat E P; Grishina O G; Zaplatkin I A; Vetrova M V; Neznanov N G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11055-017-0517-9","Keywords":"clonidine\r\ndonormil\r\ndoxylamine\r\nketorolac\r\nketorolac trometamol\r\nloperamide\r\nmetoclopramide\r\nnaftizin\r\nnaphazoline\r\nphenazepam\r\npregabalin\r\nadult\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nasthenia\r\nclinical article\r\nconstipation\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndepression\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopioid withdrawal syndrome\r\npain\r\npsychomotor disorder\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrhinorrhea\r\nside effect\r\nsingle drug dose\r\nsleep disorder\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nvomiting\r\nwellbeing\r\nwithdrawal syndrome\r\ncerucal\r\nclofelin\r\ndonormil\r\nimodium\r\nketanov\r\nlyrica\r\nnaftizin\r\nsanorin","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupitskii E M, Ilyuk R D, Mikhailov A D, Kazankov K A, Rybakova K V, Skurat E P, Grishina O G, Zaplatkin I A, Vetrova M V, and Neznanov N G (2017) A Randomized Controlled Study of the Efficacy of Pregabalin in the Treatment of Opiate Withdrawal Syndrome.

Long-acting sustained release formulations of naltrexone (implantable and injectable) might help to improve compliance and, thus, increase the efficacy of abstinence-oriented treatment of heroin dependence with naltrexone. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been several implantable and injectable formulations of naltrexone developed within the last decade. It was demonstrated that some of them are effective and relatively well tolerated medications for relapse prevention in heroin addicts. However, advantages and disadvantages of these new medications have never been systematically analyzed. SUMMARY: Long-acting sustained release formulations of naltrexone are well tolerated and more effective for relapse prevention in heroin addicts than the oral ones.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupitsky EM ; Blokhina EA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/YCO.0b013e3283386578 ","Keywords":"Delayed-Action Preparations\r\nDrug Implants\r\nHeroin Dependence/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMedication Adherence/psychology\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nSecondary Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupitsky EM, and Blokhina EA (2010) Long-acting depot formulations of naltrexone for heroin dependence: a review..

We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes of an injectable, once monthly extended-release formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) for treatment of patients with opioid dependence after detoxification. METHODS: We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week trial of patients with opioid dependence disorder. Patients aged 18 years or over who had 30 days or less of inpatient detoxification and 7 days or more off all opioids were enrolled at 13 clinical sites in Russia. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either 380 mg XR-NTX or placebo by an interactive voice response system, stratified by site and gender in a centralised, permuted-block method. Participants also received 12 biweekly counselling sessions. Participants, investigators, staff , and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the response profile for confirmed abstinence during weeks 5–24, assessed by urine drug tests and self report of non-use. Secondary endpoints were self-reported opioid-free days, opioid craving scores, number of days of retention, and relapse to physiological opioid dependence. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00678418. FINDINGS: Between July 3, 2008, and Oct 5, 2009, 250 patients were randomly assigned to XR-NTX (n=126) or placebo (n=124). The median proportion of weeks of confirmed abstinence was 90·0% (95% CI 69·9–92·4) in the XR-NTX group compared with 35·0% (11·4–63·8) in the placebo group (p=0·0002). Patients in the XR-NTX group self-reported a median of 99·2% (range 89·1–99·4) opioid-free days compared with 60·4% (46·2–94·0) for the placebo group (p=0·0004). The mean change in craving was –10·1 (95% CI –12·3 to –7·8) in the XR-NTX group compared with 0·7 (–3·1 to 4·4) in the placebo group (p<0·0001). Median retention was over 168 days in the XR-NTX group compared with 96 days (95% CI 63–165) in the placebo group (p=0·0042). Naloxone challenge confirmed relapse to physiological opioid dependence in 17 patients in the placebo group compared with one in the XR-NTX group (p<0·0001). XR-NTX was well tolerated. Two patients in each group discontinued owing to adverse events. No XR-NTX-treated patients died, overdosed, or discontinued owing to severe adverse events. INTERPRETATION: XR-NTX represents a new treatment option that is distinct from opioid agonist maintenance treatment. XR-NTX in conjunction with psychosocial treatment might improve acceptance of opioid dependence pharmacotherapy and provide a useful treatment option for many patients.

OBJECTIVE To compare outcomes of naltrexone implants, oral naltrexone hydrochloride, and nonmedication treatment. DESIGN Six-month double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial. SETTING Addiction treatment programs in St Petersburg, Russia. PARTICIPANTS Three hundred six opioid-addicted patients recently undergoing detoxification. INTERVENTIONS Biweekly counseling and 1 of the following 3 treatments for 24 weeks: (1) 1000-mg naltrexone implant and oral placebo (NI+OP group; 102 patients); (2) placebo implant and 50-mg oral naltrexone hydrochloride (PI+ON group; 102 patients); or (3) placebo implant and oral placebo (PI+OP group; 102 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Percentage of patients retained in treatment without relapse. RESULTS By month 6, 54 of 102 patients in the NI+OP group (52.9%) remained in treatment without relapse compared with 16 of 102 patients in the PI+ON group (15.7%) (survival analysis, log-rank test, P < .001) and 11 of 102 patients in the PI+OP group (10.8%) (P < .001). The PI+ON vs PI+OP comparison showed a nonsignificant trend favoring the PI+ON group (P = .07). Counting missing test results as positive, the proportion of urine screening tests yielding negative results for opiates was 63.6% (95% CI, 60%-66%) for the NI+OP group; 42.7% (40%-45%) for the PI+ON group; and 34.1% (32%-37%) for the PI+OP group (P < .001, Fisher exact test, compared with the NI+OP group). Twelve wound infections occurred among 244 implantations (4.9%) in the NI+OP group, 2 among 181 (1.1%) in the PI+ON group, and 1 among 148 (0.7%) in the PI+OP group (P = .02). All events were in the first 2 weeks after implantation and resolved with antibiotic therapy. Four local-site reactions (redness and swelling) occurred in the second month after implantation in the NI+OP group (P = .12), and all resolved with antiallergy medication treatment. Other nonlocal-site adverse effects were reported in 8 of 886 visits (0.9%) in the NI+OP group, 4 of 522 visits (0.8%) in the PI+ON group, and 3 of 394 visits (0.8%) in the PI+ON group; all resolved and none were serious. No evidence of increased deaths from overdose after naltrexone treatment ended was found. CONCLUSIONS The implant is more effective than oral naltrexone or placebo.

DESIGN: Following 6 months of randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled injections given every 28 days, patients receiving XR-NTX 380 mg continued and PBO patients were switched to open-label XR-NTX, with monthly individual drug counseling, for a further year. SETTING: Thirteen clinical sites in Russia. PARTICIPANTS: Adult opioid-dependent outpatients. MEASUREMENTS: Monthly urine samples; reports of craving and functioning; adverse events. FINDINGS: For the open-label extension (n = 114), 67 continued on XR-NTX and 47 switched from PBO during the double-blind phase to XR-NTX during the open-label phase. Overall, 62.3% (95% CI: 52.7%, 71.2%) completed the extension. Discontinuation occurred most commonly because of withdrawal of consent (18.4%) and loss to follow-up (11.4%); two patients discontinued as a result of lack of efficacy and one because of adverse events. Urine testing revealed that 50.9% (41.5%, 60.4%) were abstinent from opioids at all assessments during the 1-year open-label phase. Adverse events reported by 21.1% of patients were judged to be study drug-related. Injection site reactions were infrequent (6.1%) and the majority were mild. Elevations in liver function tests occurred for 16.7% of patients, but none of these elevations was judged to be clinically significant. No patients died, overdosed or discontinued as a result of severe adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: During a 1-year open-label extension phase of injectable XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse in opioid dependence, 62.3% of patients completed the phase and 50.9% were abstinent from opioids. No new safety concerns were evident.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupitsky E ; Nunes EV ; Ling W ; Gastfriend DR ; Memisoglu A ; Silverman BL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.12208 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nSelf Report\r\nCraving\r\ndepot naltrexone\r\nextended-release naltrexone\r\nheroin dependence\r\ninjectable naltrexone\r\nlong-term safety\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopioid dependence\r\nsustained release formulations","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupitsky E, Nunes EV, Ling W, Gastfriend DR, Memisoglu A, and Silverman BL (2013) Injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence: long-term safety and effectiveness..

Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists like guanfacine may reduce stress induced craving and have reduced opiate relapse in small clinical trials. METHODS: This randomized, double blind double dummy placebo-controlled 6-month trial tested oral naltrexone with or without guanfacine for reducing stress and preventing opiate relapse. We randomized 301 patients to: naltrexone 50 mg/day+guanfacine 1 mg/day (n=75) (N/G), naltrexone+guanfacine placebo (N/P) (n=76), naltrexone placebo+guanfacine (n=75) (P/G), and double placebo (n=75) (P/P). RESULTS: Among the 75 patients in each group the percentage still retained on naltrexone treatment at six months was: N/G 26.7%, N/P 19.7% (p=0.258 to N/G), P/G 6.7% (p<0.05 to both N groups), and P/P 10.7% (p=0.013 to N+G). Guanfacine reduced the severity of stress particularly at weeks 10 and 18. Adverse events (AE) were infrequent (4.7%) without group differences, with most common AEs: headache, poor appetite, insomnia, and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Adding guanfacine to naltrexone did not improve treatment retention or opiate free urines, but it reduced both stress and craving at later time points in treatment, which may be related to stress-induced craving and the animal model of incubation of reinstatement. During treatment, HIV risk, anxiety, and depression reduced among all patients in treatment, regardless of group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupitsky E ; Zvartau E ; Blokhina E ; Verbitskaya E ; Tsoy M ; Wahlgren V ; Burakov A ; Masalov D ; Romanova TN ; Palatkin V ; Tyurina A ; Yaroslavtseva T ; Sinha R ; Kosten TR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.04.021 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists/*administration & dosage\r\nAdult\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nGuanfacine/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/*epidemiology\r\nRussia/epidemiology\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nYoung Adult\r\nClinical trial\r\nGuanfacine\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpiate dependence\r\nStress","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupitsky E, Zvartau E, Blokhina E, Verbitskaya E, Tsoy M, Wahlgren V, Burakov A, Masalov D, Romanova TN, Palatkin V, Tyurina A, Yaroslavtseva T, Sinha R, and Kosten TR (2013) Naltrexone with or without guanfacine for preventing relapse to opiate addiction in St.-Petersburg, Russia..

The primary outcome was retention in treatment. The secondary outcomes were perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and craving. RESULTS: At the end of six months, 20 (26.7%) patients in the N+G group and 15 (19.7%) (p=0.26 to N+G) in N+GP group were retained in treatment compared to 5 (6.7%) in the NP+G group (p=0.002 to N+G group and p=0.017 to N+GP group) and 8 (10.7%) in the double placebo group (p=0.013 to N+G group). There is no significant difference in retention between the N+G group and N+GP group at the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Guanfacine had significant craving and stress reducing effect. Naltrexone was more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in opioid dependent patients. The efficacy of the combination of naltrexone and guanfacine was comparable to naltrexone alone. Guanfacine moderately reduced both stress and craving.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Krupitsky EM ; Blokhina EA ; Zvartau EE ; Verbitskaya VE ; Bushara EM ; Tiurina AA ; Palatkin VY ; Yaroslavtseva TS ; Burakov AM ; Masalov DV ; Romanova TN ; Grininko AY ; Sinha R ; Kosten T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.17116/jnevro201511510139-46 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nGuanfacine/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/prevention & control\r\nRecurrence\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Krupitsky EM, Blokhina EA, Zvartau EE, Verbitskaya VE, Bushara EM, Tiurina AA, Palatkin VY, Yaroslavtseva TS, Burakov AM, Masalov DV, Romanova TN, Grininko AY, Sinha R, and Kosten T (2015) [A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of the combined treatment with naltrexone and guanfacine for relapse prevention in opiate dependence]..

This pilot study examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the L-type calcium-channel blocker isradipine (ISR) to improve drug use outcomes, and craving and withdrawal measures during buprenorphine (BUP)/ISR stabilization and subsequent taper in opioid-dependent individuals. Methods: Participants were stabilized on BUP sublingual tablets within the first 2 days of week 1, were then randomized and inducted on either ISR or placebo, gradually increasing the dose over the next 2 weeks, followed by a 10-day BUP taper during weeks 5-6, and ISR/placebo taper during weeks 7 to 8. Assessments included thrice-weekly measures of craving and withdrawal, as well as vital signs and urine drug screens. Medication compliance was assessed by monitoring number of missed clinic visit days. Results: Baseline characteristics of participants (n = 25; 60% male, 96% Caucasian, 48% employed, mean age 32.8 years) did not differ significantly between treatment groups (isradipine, n = 11; placebo, n = 14). During the stabilization phase (n = 19), ISR participants had significantly lower rates of illicit opioid-positive urines (treatment × visit: t = -2.16, P = 0.03), as well as reduction in craving intensity (t = –2.50, P = 0.01), frequency (t = –3.43, P < 0.01) and duration (t = –2.51, P = 0.01). ISR was well tolerated with mild adverse effects. Conclusions: This study was likely underpowered due to being a pilot trial. Although preliminary results suggest ISR may improve BUP-assisted treatment outcomes, concerns about high number of exclusions (n = 11 during taper phase) based on cardiovascular measures as well as ISR-induced changes in vital signs with the immediate release formulation may limit the feasibility of this approach.

We conducted a systematic review of published model-based economic evaluations of drug substitution therapy in treating nonmedical opioid dependence. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in March 2015 in 8 electronic databases and supplemented by hand-searching reference lists and searches on 6 health technology assessment (HTA) agency websites. The selection criteria included: A population dependent on opioids and receiving opioid substitution therapy or maintenance therapy. The intervention included any pharmacological maintenance therapy and the comparator included any pharmacological maintenance regimen, including placebo or no treatment. The outcomes and study types included health economic models of any type. Results: After removal of duplicates, 2,163 citations were retrieved, of which 63 progressed to full-text review. Of these, 19 publications of 18 unique models were included in the review. These 18 models used a wide range of modelling approaches, including Markov models (n= 4), decision tree with Monte Carlo simulations (n= 4), decision analysis (n= 3), dynamic transmission models (n= 3), decision tree (n= 1), cohort simulation (n= 1), Bayesian (n= 1), and Monte Carlo simulations for sensitivity analysis (n= 1). Time horizons ranged from 6 months to a lifetime. The most common evaluation was cost-utility analysis reporting cost per quality-adjusted life-year (n= 11), followed by cost-effectiveness analysis (n= 4), budget impact analysis/cost comparison (n= 2) and cost-benefit analysis (n= 1). Countries modelled were the US (n= 11), UK (n= 4), Spain (n= 1), Vietnam (n= 1) and New Zealand (n= 1). A range of perspectives were modelled, including societal and healthcare systems. Conclusions: This review identified 8 different modelling structures with a range of perspectives, time horizons and inputs, illustrating that there is no single preferred approach. Further research is needed into the advantages and disadvantages of the different modelling approaches in this disease area.","Comments":"2015-11-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Langham S ; Kenworthy J J; Dunlop W ; Chetty M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"opiate\r\nplacebo\r\nmodel\r\neconomic evaluation\r\ndrug substitution\r\nsubstitution therapy\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nprescription\r\nopiate addiction\r\nEuropean\r\nsystematic review\r\nMonte Carlo method\r\nhealth\r\ndecision tree\r\ndata base\r\nstatistical model\r\ncost benefit analysis\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nNew Zealand\r\ncost effectiveness analysis\r\ncost utility analysis\r\npopulation\r\nlifespan\r\nsensitivity analysis\r\nquality adjusted life year\r\ntechnology\r\nsimulation\r\nbudget\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nSpain\r\nViet Nam\r\nhealth care system","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Langham S, Kenworthy J J, Dunlop W, and Chetty M (2015) A systematic review of model-based economic evaluations of drug substitution therapies in maintenance treatment of non-prescription opioid dependence.

We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the safety and efficacy of naltrexone implants for treating opioid dependence. Design and Methods: Studies were eligible if they compared naltrexone implants with another intervention or placebo. Examined outcomes were induction to treatment, retention in treatment, opioid and non-opioid use, adverse events, non-fatal overdose and mortality. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Data from randomised studies were combined using meta-analysis. Data from non-randomised studies were presented narratively. Results: Five randomised trials (n=576) and four non-randomised studies (n=8358) were eligible for review. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low. Naltrexone implants were superior to placebo implants [risk ratio (RR): 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48, 0.68; k=2] and oral naltrexone (RR: 0.57; 95% CI 0.47, 0.70; k=2) in suppressing opioid use. No difference in opioid use was observed between naltrexone implants and methadone maintenance (standardised mean difference: -0.33; 95% CI -0.93, 0.26; k=1); however, this finding was based on low-quality evidence from one study. Discussion: The evidence on safety and efficacy of naltrexone implants is limited in quantity and quality, and the evidence has little clinical utility in settings where effective treatments for opioid dependence are used. Conclusion: Better designed research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of naltrexone implants. Until such time, their use should be limited to clinical trials. © 2013 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.","Comments":"2014-11-03","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Larney S ; Gowing L ; Mattick R P; Farrell M ; Hall W ; Degenhardt L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/dar.12095","Keywords":"diamorphine\r\nnaltrexone\r\nnarcotic antagonist\r\ndrug implant\r\nhuman\r\nexperimental therapy\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Larney S, Gowing L, Mattick R P, Farrell M, Hall W, and Degenhardt L (2014) A systematic review and meta-analysis of naltrexone implants for the treatment of opioid dependence.

We assessed changes in pain among individuals receiving treatment with either extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride or buprenorphine-naloxone hydrochloride. METHODS: This randomized prospective open-label clinical study included 143 participants (aged 18-60 years) with opioid dependencies, recruited from outpatient addiction clinics at five urban hospitals in Norway. After in-patient detoxification from opioids, patients were randomized to 12-week treatment with either long-acting naltrexone (380 mg intramuscularly injected every four weeks) or buprenorphine-naloxone (flexible 4-16 mg sublingual doses daily). This phase was followed by a 9-month open-treatment study with the participant's choice of either naltrexone or buprenorphine-naloxone. Changes in pain were assessed every 4 weeks using the Norwegian Short-Form of McGill Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS: Throughout the study period, we found no increase in mean sensory pain, affective pain, or present pain intensity on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, in either treatment group, including the subgroups of participants with chronic pain. Participants who switched from buprenorphine-naloxone to extended-release naltrexone treatment after week 12 reported no increase in pain intensity during longer-term treatment. Women experienced significantly more affective pain symptoms than men (p = .01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with opioid use disorder, switching from daily opioid use to long-acting naltrexone did not induce pain, or aggravate mild-to-moderate chronic pain. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: In opioid-dependent individuals, mild-to-moderate chronic pain was not influenced by opioid agonist or antagonist treatment.

We report the first randomised controlled trial to compare the effects of these two medications on withdrawal symptoms and outcome during opiate induction/stabilisation and detoxification. A double-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted in an outpatient satellite clinic of a specialist drug service. Eighty opiate dependent individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for opiate dependence, using ⩽ ½ g heroin smoked/chased or ¼ g heroin injected or ⩽ 30mg methadone, with ⩽ 3 years of opioid dependency, underwent a short-term opiate treatment programme involving induction/stabilisation on methadone 30mg or buprenorphine/naloxone 4mg/1mg, followed by detoxification (where the methadone group was assisted by lofexidine). The main outcome measures were urine drug screens for opiates and withdrawal and craving questionnaires. There were no overall differences in positive urine drug screens and drop-outs during any phase of the study. During induction/stabilisation, withdrawal symptoms subsided more slowly for buprenorphine/naloxone than for methadone, and craving was significantly higher in the buprenorphine/naloxone group ( p<0.05, 95% confidence interval -3.5, -0.38). During detoxification, withdrawal symptoms were significantly greater and the peak of withdrawal was earlier for the methadone/lofexidine group than the buprenorphine/naloxone group ( p<0.01, 95% confidence interval 3.0, 8.3). Methadone/lofexidine and buprenorphine/naloxone had comparable outcomes during rapid outpatient stabilisation and detoxification in low dose opiate users.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Law FD ; Diaper AM ; Melichar JK ; Coulton S ; Nutt DJ ; Myles JS ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0269881117711710 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/*therapeutic use\r\nClonidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use\r\nCraving/drug effects\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBuprenorphine\r\ndetoxification\r\nlofexidine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate withdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Law FD, Diaper AM, Melichar JK, Coulton S, Nutt DJ, and Myles JS (2017) Buprenorphine/naloxone versus methadone and lofexidine in community stabilisation and detoxification: A randomised controlled trial of low dose short-term opiate-dependent individuals..

We estimated the feasibility and effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) as relapse prevention among opioid-dependent male adults leaving a large urban jail. DESIGN: Eight-week, proof-of-concept, open-label, non-blinded randomized effectiveness trial. SETTING: New York City jails and Bellevue Hospital Center Adult Primary Care clinics, USA. PARTICIPANTS: From January 2010 to July 2013, 34 opioid-dependent adult males with no stated interest in agonist treatments (methadone, buprenorphine) received a counseling and referral intervention and were randomized to XR-NTX (n = 17) versus no medication (n = 17) within one week prior to jail release. INTERVENTION: XR-NTX (Vivitrol(®) ; Alkermes Inc.), a long-acting injectable mu opioid receptor antagonist. MEASURES: The primary intent-to-treat outcome was post-release opioid relapse at week 4, defined as ≥10 days of opioid misuse by self-report and urine toxicologies. Secondary outcomes were proportion of urine samples negative for opioids and rates of opioid abstinence, intravenous drug use (IVDU), cocaine use, community treatment participation, re-incarceration and overdose. FINDINGS: Acceptance of XR-NTX was high; 15 of 17 initiated treatment. Rates of the primary outcome of week 4 opioid relapse were lower among XR-NTX participants: 38 versus 88% [P<0.004; odds ratio (OR) = 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01-0.48]; more XR-NTX urine samples were negative for opioids, 59 versus 29% (P<0.009; OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.4-8.5). There were no significant differences in the remaining secondary outcomes, including rates of IVDU, cocaine use, re-incarceration and overdose. CONCLUSION: Extended-release naltrexone is associated with significantly lower rates of opioid relapse among men in the United States following release from jail when compared with a no medication treatment-as-usual condition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee JD ; McDonald R ; Grossman E ; McNeely J ; Laska E ; Rotrosen J ; Gourevitch MN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.12894 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nNew York City\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nPilot Projects\r\n*Prisoners\r\nRecurrence\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nVivitrol\r\njail\r\nopioid dependence\r\nprisoners\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrelapse prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee JD, McDonald R, Grossman E, McNeely J, Laska E, Rotrosen J, and Gourevitch MN (2015) Opioid treatment at release from jail using extended-release naltrexone: a pilot proof-of-concept randomized effectiveness trial..

METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to a group: DM60 (60mg/day dextromethorphan; n = 65), DM120 (120mg/day dextromethorphan; n = 65), or placebo (n = 66). Primary outcomes were the methadone dose required, plasma morphine level, and retention in treatment. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor-β1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were examined during weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, and 12.

Plasma TNF-α was significantly decreased in the DM60 group compared to the placebo group. However, changes in plasma cytokine levels, BDNF levels, and the methadone dose required in the three groups were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence-decreased concomitant heroin use-of low-dose add-on DM's efficacy for treating opioid-dependent patients undergoing MMT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee SY ; Chen SL ; Chang YH ; Chu CH ; Chen SH ; Chen PS ; Huang SY ; Tzeng NS ; Wang LJ ; Lee IH ; Wang TY ; Chen KC ; Yang YK ; Hong JS ; Lu RB ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ijnp/pyv008 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/toxicity\r\nBrain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/blood\r\nC-Reactive Protein\r\nDextromethorphan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination/methods\r\nExcitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInterleukin-6/blood\r\nInterleukin-8/blood\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nMorphine/*toxicity\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/blood/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nRetention, Psychology/*drug effects\r\nTime Factors\r\nTransforming Growth Factor beta1/blood\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nTumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood\r\nCytokines\r\nDextromethorphan\r\nHeroin\r\ncytokine\r\ndextromethorphan\r\nmethadone maintenance therapy\r\nopioid dependence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee SY, Chen SL, Chang YH, Chu CH, Chen SH, Chen PS, Huang SY, Tzeng NS, Wang LJ, Lee IH, Wang TY, Chen KC, Yang YK, Hong JS, and Lu RB (2015) A placebo-controlled trial of dextromethorphan as an adjunct in opioid-dependent patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment..

Data supporting its effectiveness in U.S. criminal justice populations are limited. METHODS: In this five-site, open-label, randomized trial, we compared a 24-week course of extended-release naltrexone (Vivitrol) with usual treatment, consisting of brief counseling and referrals for community treatment programs, for the prevention of opioid relapse among adult criminal justice offenders (i.e., persons involved in the U.S. criminal justice system) who had a history of opioid dependence and a preference for opioid-free rather than opioid maintenance treatments and who were abstinent from opioids at the time of randomization. The primary outcome was the time to an opioid-relapse event, which was defined as 10 or more days of opioid use in a 28-day period as assessed by self-report or by testing of urine samples obtained every 2 weeks; a positive or missing sample was computed as 5 days of opioid use. Post-treatment follow-up occurred at weeks 27, 52, and 78. RESULTS: A total of 153 participants were assigned to extended-release naltrexone and 155 to usual treatment. During the 24-week treatment phase, participants assigned to extended-release naltrexone had a longer median time to relapse than did those assigned to usual treatment (10.5 vs. 5.0 weeks, P<0.001; hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.68), a lower rate of relapse (43% vs. 64% of participants, P<0.001; odds ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.65), and a higher rate of opioid-negative urine samples (74% vs. 56%, P<0.001; odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.48 to 3.54). At week 78 (approximately 1 year after the end of the treatment phase), rates of opioid-negative urine samples were equal (46% in each group, P=0.91). The rates of other prespecified secondary outcome measures--self-reported cocaine, alcohol, and intravenous drug use, unsafe sex, and reincarceration--were not significantly lower with extended-release naltrexone than with usual treatment. Over the total 78 weeks observed, there were no overdose events in the extended-release naltrexone group and seven in the usual-treatment group (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving criminal justice offenders, extended-release naltrexone was associated with a rate of opioid relapse that was lower than that with usual treatment. Opioid-use prevention effects waned after treatment discontinuation.

OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment retention following release from jail among adults receiving daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (SLB) vs those receiving XRB. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label, randomized comparative effectiveness study included 52 incarcerated adults in New York City observed for 8 weeks postrelease between June 2019 and May 2020. Participants were soon-to-be-released volunteers from 1 men's and 1 women's jail facility who had OUDs already treated with SLB. Follow-up treatment was received at a primary care clinic in Manhattan. Data were analyzed between June 2020 and December 2020. INTERVENTIONS: XRB treatment was offered prior to release and continued monthly through 8 weeks after release. SLB participants continued to receive daily directly observed in-jail SLB administration, were provided a 7-day SLB supply at jail release, and followed up at a designated clinic (or other preferred clinics). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Buprenorphine treatment retention at 8 weeks postrelease. RESULTS: A total of 52 participants were randomized 1:1 to XRB (26 participants) and SLB (26 participants). Participants had a mean (SD) age of 42.6 (10.0) years; 45 participants (87%) were men; and 40 (77%) primarily used heroin prior to incarceration. Most participants (30 [58%]) reported prior buprenorphine use; 18 (35%) reported active community buprenorphine treatment prior to jail admission. Twenty-one of 26 assigned to XRB received 1 or more XRB injection prior to release; 3 initiated XRB postrelease; and 2 did not receive XRB. Patients in the XRB arm had fewer jail medical visits compared with daily SLB medication administration (mean [SD] visits per day: XRB, 0.11 [0.03] vs SLB, 1.06 [0.08]). Community buprenorphine treatment retention at week 8 postrelease was 18 participants in the XRB group (69.2%) vs 9 in the SLB group (34.6%), and rates of opioid-negative urine tests were 72 of 130 tests in the XRB group (55.3%) and 50 of 130 tests in the SLB group (38.4%). There were no differences in rates of serious adverse events, no overdoses, and no deaths. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: XRB was acceptable among patients currently receiving SLB, and patients had fewer in-jail clinic visits and increased community buprenorphine treatment retention when compared with standard daily SLB treatment. These results support wider use and further study of XRB as correctional and reentry OUD treatment.

This study examined patient characteristics and rates of treatment completion and engagement in post-residential care of opioid dependent patients who received XR-NTX during residential rehabilitation, compared with patients who did not receive this medication. METHODS: Electronic records for opioid dependent patients from three Pennsylvania residential detoxification and treatment facilities (N = 7,687) were retrospectively analyzed. We determined the proportion of patients who received XR-NTX (INJ), and compared rates of treatment completion and engagement in follow-up care relative to a naturalistic control group of patients recommended for, but not administered, XR-NTX (Non-INJ). Data on whether the patient initiated follow-up care were available from one site (N = 3,724). RESULTS: Overall, 598 (7.8%) patients were recommended for XR-NTX and of these, 168 (28.1%) received injections. Compared to non-INJ patients, INJ patients were less likely to leave against medical advice (4.8% vs. 30.2%, p < .001) and more likely to initiate follow-up care (37.7% vs. 19.7%, p < .001). These differences remained significant after controlling for demographic covariates using regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: XR-NTX was associated with higher rates of residential and early post-residential care engagement in patients with opioid dependence.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether buprenorphine administration during medical hospitalization and linkage to office-based buprenorphine OAT after discharge increase entry into office-based OAT, increase sustained engagement in OAT, and decrease illicit opioid use at 6 months after hospitalization. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From August 1, 2009, through October 31, 2012, a total of 663 hospitalized, opioid-dependent patients in a general medical hospital were identified. Of these, 369 did not meet eligibility criteria. A total of 145 eligible patients consented to participation in the randomized clinical trial. Of these, 139 completed the baseline interview and were assigned to the detoxification (n = 67) or linkage (n = 72) group. INTERVENTIONS: Five-day buprenorphine detoxification protocol or buprenorphine induction, intrahospital dose stabilization, and postdischarge transition to maintenance buprenorphine OAT affiliated with the hospital's primary care clinic (linkage). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Entry and sustained engagement with buprenorphine OAT at 1, 3, and 6 months (medical record verified) and prior 30-day use of illicit opioids (self-report). RESULTS: During follow-up, linkage participants were more likely to enter buprenorphine OAT than those in the detoxification group (52 [72.2%] vs 8 [11.9%], P < .001). At 6 months, 12 linkage participants (16.7%) and 2 detoxification participants (3.0%) were receiving buprenorphine OAT (P = .007). Compared with those in the detoxification group, participants randomized to the linkage group reported less illicit opioid use in the 30 days before the 6-month interview (incidence rate ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46-0.73; P < .01) in an intent-to-treat analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with an inpatient detoxification protocol, initiation of and linkage to buprenorphine treatment is an effective means for engaging medically hospitalized patients who are not seeking addiction treatment and reduces illicit opioid use 6 months after hospitalization. However, maintaining engagement in treatment remains a challenge.

Methadone and buprenorphine have been associated with reduced opioid IDU; however, the effect of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) on this behavior is incompletely studied. METHODS: This study examined injection opioid use and shared injection equipment behavior from a completed double-blind placebo-controlled trial of XR-NTX among 88 justice-involved participants with HIV and OUD. Changes in participants' self-reported daily injection opioid use and shared injection equipment was evaluated pre-incarceration, during incarceration, and monthly post-release for 6 months. The study also assessed differences in time to first opioid injection post-release. The research team performed intention to treat and \"as treated\" (high treatment versus low treatment) analyses. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 88 participants (69.5 %) endorsed IDU and 26 (29.5 %) reported sharing injection equipment in the 30 days pre-incarceration; 2 participants (2.2 %) reported IDU during incarceration; 19 (21.6 %) reported IDU one month post-release from prison or jail. Fifty-four (61.4 %) participants had an HIV RNA below 200 copies/mL and 62 (70.5 %) were baseline HCV antibody positive. The 6-month follow-up rate was 49.5 % and 50.5 % for those who received XR-NTX and placebo, respectively, which was not significantly different (p = 0.822). Participants in the XR-NTX and placebo groups had similar low mean opioid injection use post-release and time to first injection opioid use in the Intention-to-treat analysis. In the as-treated analysis, participants in the high treatment group had significantly lower mean proportion of days injecting opioids (13.8 % high treatment versus 22.8 % low treatment, p = 0.02) by month 1, which persisted up to 5 months post-release (0 % high treatment vs 24.3 % low treatment, p < 0.001) and experienced a longer time to first opioid injection post-release (143.8 days high treatment vs 67.4 days low treatment, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Injection opioid use was low during incarceration and remained low post-release in this justice-involved population. Retention on XR-NTX was associated with reduced intravenous opioid use, which has important implications for reducing transmission of HIV and HCV.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lier AJ ; Seval N ; Vander Wyk B; Di Paola A ; Springer SA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108852 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\n*HIV Infections/drug therapy\r\n*Hepatitis C/complications/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/rehabilitation\r\nRNA/therapeutic use\r\nSocial Justice\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nHIV\r\nHepatitis C virus\r\nInjection drug use\r\nMedications for opioid use disorder\r\nOpioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lier AJ, Seval N, Vander Wyk B, Di Paola A, and Springer SA (2022) Maintenance on extended-release naltrexone is associated with reduced injection opioid use among justice-involved persons with opioid use disorder..

However, previous meta-analyses have been limited to pairwise comparisons of these interventions, and their efficacy relative to all others remains unclear. Our objective was to unify findings from different healthcare practices and generate evidence to strengthen clinical treatment protocols for the most widely prescribed medications for opioid-use disorders. Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCT) from database inception to February 12, 2022. Primary outcome was treatment retention, and secondary outcome was opioid use measured by urinalysis. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% credible interval (CrI) using Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) for available evidence. We assessed the credibility of the NMA using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis tool. Results Seventy-nine RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Due to heterogeneity in measuring opioid use and reporting format between studies, we conducted NMA only for treatment retention. Methadone was the highest ranked intervention (Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking [SUCRA] = 0.901) in the network with control being the lowest (SUCRA = 0.000). Methadone was superior to buprenorphine for treatment retention (RR = 1.22; 95% CrI = 1.06-1.40) and buprenorphine superior to naltrexone (RR = 1.39; 95% CrI = 1.10-1.80). However, due to a limited number of high-quality trials, confidence in the network estimates of other treatment pairs involving naltrexone and slow-release oral morphine (SROM) remains low. Conclusion All treatments had higher retention than the non-pharmacotherapeutic control group. However, additional high-quality RCTs are needed to estimate more accurately the extent of efficacy of naltrexone and SROM relative to other medications. For pharmacotherapies with established efficacy profiles, assessment of their long-term comparative effectiveness may be warranted.","Comments":"2022-04-27","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lim J ; Farhat I ; Douros A ; Panagiotoglou D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0266142","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nmorphine\r\nnaltrexone\r\narticle\r\nclinical outcome\r\nclinical protocol\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug use\r\nhealth care practice\r\nhuman\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprescription\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lim J, Farhat I, Douros A, and Panagiotoglou D (2022) Relative effectiveness of medications for opioid-related disorders: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

DESIGN: This multi-site study sponsored by Clinical Trials Network (CTN, a branch of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse) was conducted from 2003 to 2005 to compare two taper conditions (7 days and 28 days). Data were collected at weekly clinic visits to the end of the taper periods, and at 1-month and 3-month post-taper follow-up visits. SETTING: Eleven out-patient treatment programs in 10 US cities. INTERVENTION: Non-blinded dosing with Suboxone during the 1-month stabilization phase included 3 weeks of flexible dosing as determined appropriate by the study physicians. A fixed dose was required for the final week before beginning the taper phase. MEASUREMENTS: The percentage of participants in each taper group providing urine samples free of illicit opioids at the end of the taper and at follow-up. FINDINGS: At the end of the taper, 44% of the 7-day taper group (n = 255) provided opioid-free urine specimens compared to 30% of the 28-day taper group (n = 261; P = 0.0007).

This randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness of four behavioral treatment conditions provided with buprenorphine and medical management (MM) for the treatment of opioid dependence. DESIGN: After a 2-week buprenorphine induction/stabilization phase, participants were randomized to one of four behavioral treatment conditions provided for 16 weeks: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT = 53); contingency management (CM = 49); both CBT and CM (CBT + CM = 49); and no additional behavioral treatment (NT = 51). SETTING: Study activities occurred at an out-patient clinical research center in Los Angeles, California, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Included were 202 male and female opioid-dependent participants. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was opioid use, measured as a proportion of opioid-negative urine results over the number of tests possible. Secondary outcomes include retention, withdrawal symptoms, craving, other drug use and adverse events. FINDINGS: No group differences in opioid use were found for the behavioral treatment phase (χ2 = 1.25, P = 0.75), for a second medication-only treatment phase, or at weeks 40 and 52 follow-ups. Analyses revealed no differences across groups for any secondary outcome.

Currently, buprenorphine is one of the most common pharmacological interventions used to treat opioid use disorder. Despite increasing prevalence of opioid use disorder among females, little is known about sex considerations in relation to treatment with buprenorphine. METHODS: CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Central were searched for randomized controlled trials examining buprenorphine maintenance versus other medication-assisted treatment, placebo, or withdrawal management to determine if there were any sex differences in treatment outcomes reported. RESULTS: This review included 25 studies and found that only 52% included information related to sex differences in treatment outcomes or discussed any sex considerations in their studies. Of the 6,466 patients represented by these studies, only 26% were female. Of the studies conducting sex-specific analyses, seven studies examined treatment retention, five examined opioid use, two examined other substance use and one examined sexual risk behaviours. However, due to mixed findings, small sample sizes, and inability to conduct meta-analyses, no conclusive statements can be made about sex differences in these outcomes. None of the studies described sex differences in quality of life, legal involvement or mental and physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Low numbers of females have been included in randomized controlled trials examining buprenorphine compared to males. While sex differences in treatment outcomes were identified in this review, further research is needed in order to add to these findings. Future studies should include greater numbers of female participants and conduct sex-specific analyses.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ling S ; Mangaoil R ; Cleverley K ; Sproule B ; Puts M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.02.007 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nClinical Trials as Topic/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNorth America/epidemiology\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods/psychology\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology\r\nQuality of Life/psychology\r\n*Sex Characteristics\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nBuprenorphine/naloxone\r\nGender differences\r\nMedication assisted treatment\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid maintenance treatment\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nRetention\r\nSex differences","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ling S, Mangaoil R, Cleverley K, Sproule B, and Puts M (2019) A systematic review of sex differences in treatment outcomes among people with opioid use disorder receiving buprenorphine maintenance versus other treatment conditions..

This analysis assessed the effects of RBP-6000, referred to as BUP-XR (extended-release buprenorphine), a subcutaneously injected, monthly buprenorphine treatment for OUD compared with placebo on patient-centered outcomes measuring meaningful life changes. METHODS: Patient-centered outcomes were collected in a 24-week, phase 3, placebo-controlled study assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BUP-XR 300/300 mg (6 × 300 mg) and 300/100 mg (2 × 300 mg followed by 4 × 100 mg) injections in treatment-seeking participants with moderate-to-severe OUD. Measures included the EQ-5D-5L, SF-36v2, Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire, employment/insurance status, and healthcare resource utilization (HCRU). Changes from baseline to end of study were compared across treatment arms, using mixed models for repeated measures. RESULTS: Participants receiving BUP-XR (n = 389) versus placebo (n = 98) had significantly greater changes from baseline on the EQ-5D-5L index (300/300 mg: difference = 0.0636, P = 0.003), EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (300/300 mg: difference = 5.9, P = 0.017; 300/100 mg: difference = 7.7, P = 0.002), and SF-36v2 physical component summary score (300/300 mg: difference = 3.8, P < 0.001; 300/100 mg: difference = 3.2, P = 0.002). Satisfaction was significantly higher for participants receiving BUP-XR 300/300 mg (88%, P < 0.001) and 300/100 mg (88%, P < 0.001) than placebo (46%). Employment and percentage of insured participants increased by 10.8% and 4.1% with BUP-XR 300/300 mg and 10.0% and 4.7% with 300/100 mg but decreased by 12.6% and 8.4% with placebo. Participants receiving BUP-XR compared with placebo had significantly fewer hospital days per person-year observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of measuring patient-centered life changes in substance use disorder clinical studies. Participants receiving up to 6 monthly injections of BUP-XR, compared with placebo, reported better health, increased medication satisfaction, increased employment, and decreased healthcare utilization.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ling W ; Nadipelli VR ; Solem CT ; Ronquest NA ; Yeh YC ; Learned SM ; Mehra V ; Heidbreder C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000517 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/blood/urine\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nEmployment\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Subcutaneous\r\nInsurance, Health/economics\r\nLogistic Models\r\nMale\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care\r\nPatient Compliance\r\nPatient Satisfaction/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPatient-Centered Care\r\n*Quality of Life\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ling W, Nadipelli VR, Solem CT, Ronquest NA, Yeh YC, Learned SM, Mehra V, and Heidbreder C (2019) Patient-centered Outcomes in Participants of a Buprenorphine Monthly Depot (BUP-XR) Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study..

STUDY DESIGN: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Clinical Trials, and Web of Science were searched to identify studies assessing the relationship between maternal buprenorphine-naloxone use and pregnancy outcomes. Outcomes assessed included neonatal abstinence syndrome diagnosis and treatment, neonatal intensive care unit admission, length of neonatal hospital stay, delivery complications, mode of delivery, labor analgesia, illicit drug use, medication-assisted treatment dosage, gestational age at delivery, breastfeeding status, miscarriage, congenital anomalies, intrauterine fetal demise, birthweight, head circumference, length, and Apgar scores. RESULTS: Overall, 5 studies comprising 6 study groups met the inclusion criteria. Of the 1875 mother-baby dyads available for analysis, medications prescribed as part of the medication-assisted treatment included buprenorphine-naloxone, buprenorphine alone, methadone, or long-acting opioids. There were no serious adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes associated with maternal buprenorphine-naloxone use reported among any of the studies. Women prescribed with buprenorphine-naloxone for delivered neonates who were less likely to require treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome were compared with pregnant women prescribed with other opioid agonist medications. Of the remaining outcomes assessed, metaanalysis did not detect any statistically significant differences when comparing the groups of women using buprenorphine-naloxone with the groups of women prescribed with other medications as part of the medication-assisted treatment. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women undergoing treatment for opioid use disorder with buprenorphine-naloxone do not experience significantly different pregnancy outcomes than women undergoing treatment with other forms of opioid agonist medication-assisted therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Link HM ; Jones H ; Miller L ; Kaltenbach K ; Seligman N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100179 ","Keywords":"*Buprenorphine/adverse effects\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nPregnancy\r\n*Pregnancy Complications/drug therapy\r\nPregnancy Outcome\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine-naloxone\r\nmedication-assisted treatment\r\nmethadone\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nopioid use disorder\r\npregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Link HM, Jones H, Miller L, Kaltenbach K, and Seligman N (2020) Buprenorphine-naloxone use in pregnancy: a systematic review and metaanalysis..

This study aimed to implement and evaluate recent national Australian guidelines for transferring patients from methadone to buprenorphine. Design and Methods: A multisite prospective cohort study. Participants were patients who transferred from methadone to buprenorphine-naloxone at 1 of 4 specialist addiction centers in Australia and New Zealand. Clinicians were trained in the guidelines, and medical records were reviewed to examine process (eg, transfer setting, doses, and guideline adherence) and safety (precipitated withdrawal) measures. Participants completed research interviews before and after transfer-assessing changes in substance use, health outcomes, and side effects. Results: In all, 33 participants underwent transfer, 9 from low methadone doses (<30mg), 9 from medium doses (30-50mg), and 15 from high doses (>50mg). The majority of high-dose transfers occurred in inpatient settings. There was reasonable guideline adherence, and no complications identified in the low and medium-dose transfers. Three high-dose transfers (20%) experienced precipitated withdrawal, and 7/33 participants (21%) returned to methadone within 1 week of attempted transfer. Discussions and Conclusions: Transfer is feasible in outpatient settings for those transferring from methadone doses below 50mg; however, inpatient settings and specialist supervision is recommended for higher-dose transfers. The Australian clinical guidelines appear safe and feasible, although further research is required to optimize high-dose transfer procedures.","Comments":"2019-10-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lintzeris N ; Monds L A; Rivas C ; Leung S ; Dunlop A ; Newcombe D ; Walters C ; Galea S ; White N ; Montebello M ; Demirkol A ; Swanson N ; Ali R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000396","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nAustralia\r\nclinical article\r\ncohort analysis\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug substitution\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfeasibility study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmedical record\r\nmulticenter study\r\nNew Zealand\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npatient satisfaction\r\npractice guideline\r\npriority journal\r\nprotocol compliance\r\nsubstance use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lintzeris N, Monds L A, Rivas C, Leung S, Dunlop A, Newcombe D, Walters C, Galea S, White N, Montebello M, Demirkol A, Swanson N, and Ali R (2018) Transferring Patients from Methadone to Buprenorphine: The Feasibility and Evaluation of Practice Guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To compare patient satisfaction between depot buprenorphine and sublingual buprenorphine in adult outpatients with opioid dependence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted among adult patients with opioid dependence at 6 outpatient clinical sites in Australia from October 2018 to September 2019. Data analysis was conducted from October 2019 to May 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive treatment with weekly or monthly depot buprenorphine or daily sublingual buprenorphine over 24 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the difference in global treatment satisfaction, assessed by the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) version 1.4 (range, 0-100; higher score indicates greater satisfaction) at week 24. Secondary end points included other patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life, treatment burden, and health-related outcomes, as well as measures of opioid use, retention in treatment, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 119 participants (70 [58.8%] men; mean [SD] age, 44.4 [10.5] years) were enrolled, randomized to, and received either depot buprenorphine (60 participants [50.4%]) or sublingual buprenorphine (59 participants [49.6%]). From the initial sample of 120, a participant (0.8%) in the sublingual buprenorphine group withdrew consent and did not receive study treatment. All participants were receiving sublingual buprenorphine when enrolled. The mean TSQM global satisfaction score was significantly higher for the depot group compared with the sublingual group at week 24 (mean [SE] score, 82.5 [2.3] vs 74.3 [2.3]; difference, 8.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 14.6; P = .01). Improved outcomes were also observed for several secondary end points after treatment with depot buprenorphine (eg, mean [SE] treatment burden assessed by the Treatment Burden Questionnaire global score, on which lower scores indicate lower burden: 13.2 [2.6] vs 28.6 [2.5]; difference, -15.4; 95% CI, -22.6 to -8.2; P < .001). Thirty-nine participants (65.0%) in the depot buprenorphine group experienced 117 adverse drug reactions, mainly injection site reactions of mild intensity following subcutaneous administration, and 12 participants (20.3%) in the sublingual buprenorphine group experienced 21 adverse drug reactions. No participants withdrew from the trial medication or the trial due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, participants receiving depot buprenorphine reported improved treatment satisfaction compared with those receiving sublingual buprenorphine. The results highlight the application of patient-reported outcomes as alternative end points to traditional markers of substance use in addiction treatment outcome studies.

Prior studies highlight few medication treatment providers for opioid use disorder in rural communities, though literature has yet to examine rural-specific treatment barriers. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review to highlight the state of knowledge around rural medication treatment for opioid use disorder, identify consumer- and provider-focused treatment barriers, and discuss rural-specific implications. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature using PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases (January 2018). Articles meeting inclusion criteria involved rural samples or urban/rural comparisons targeting outpatient medication treatment for opioid use disorder, and were conducted in the U.S. to minimize healthcare differences. Our analysis categorized consumer- and/or provider-focused barriers, and coded barriers as related to treatment availability, accessibility, and/or acceptability. Results: Eighteen articles met inclusion, 15 which addressed consumer-focused barriers, while seven articles reported provider-focused barriers. Availability barriers were most commonly reported across consumer (n = 10) and provider (n = 5) studies, and included the lack of clinics/providers, backup, and resources. Acceptability barriers, described in three consumer and five provider studies, identified negative provider attitudes about addiction treatment, and providers’ perceptions of treatment as unsatisfactory for rural patients. Finally, accessibility barriers related to travel and cost were detailed in four consumer-focused studies whereas two provider-focused studies identified time constraints. Conclusions: Our findings consistently identified a lack of medication providers and rural-specific implementation challenges. This review highlights a lack of rural-focused studies involving consumer participants, treatment outcomes, or barriers impacting underserved populations. There is a need for innovative treatment delivery for opioid use disorder in rural communities and interventions targeting provider attitudes.","Comments":"2020-07-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lister J J; Weaver A ; Ellis J D; Himle J A; Ledgerwood D M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2019.1694536","Keywords":"consumer\r\nhealth care access\r\nhealth care cost\r\nhealth personnel attitude\r\nhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutpatient care\r\nperception\r\npharmaceutical care\r\nprogram acceptability\r\nreview\r\nrural population\r\nsystematic review\r\ntravel\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lister J J, Weaver A, Ellis J D, Himle J A, and Ledgerwood D M (2020) A systematic review of rural-specific barriers to medication treatment for opioid use disorder in the United States.

It has no abuse potential, mild and transient side effects, and thus appears an ideal pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence. Its effectiveness in alcohol dependence is less evident, but compliance with naltrexone combined with psychosocial support has been repeatedly shown to improve drinking outcomes. Limited compliance with oral naltrexone treatment is a known drawback. Several naltrexone implant and injectable depot formulations are being investigated and provide naltrexone release for at least 1 month. Studies among opioid-dependent patients indicate significant reductions in heroin use, but sample sizes are usually small. In alcohol dependence, two large multicenter trials report alcohol and craving reductions for naltrexone and placebo groups, indicating a significant but moderate effect. The pharmacokinetic profile of the injectable formulation indicates reliable naltrexone release over 1 month at therapeutic levels. Implant formulations releasing naltrexone up to 7 months are reported. Findings on safety and tolerability confirm the generally mild adverse effects described for naltrexone tablets. However, further research on therapeutic levels (i.e., opioid blocking) is warranted. The majority of naltrexone implants lacks approval for regular clinical use and larger longitudinal studies are needed. The available naltrexone depot formulations have the potential to significantly improve medication compliance in opioid and alcohol dependence. In certain circumstances, they may constitute a promising new treatment option. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Comments":"2011-12-07","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lobmaier P P; Kunøe N ; Gossop M ; Waal H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1755-5949.2010.00194.x","Keywords":"naltrexone\r\noneil implant\r\nplacebo\r\nprodetoxon\r\nunclassified drug\r\nwedgewood implant\r\nalcoholism\r\nallergy\r\napplication site infection\r\napplication site inflammation\r\napplication site pain\r\ncognitive defect\r\ndrug formulation\r\ndrug implant\r\ndrug mechanism\r\ndrug metabolism\r\ndrug release\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nheadache\r\nhuman\r\nmuscle twitch\r\nnausea\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\npsychosocial care\r\nquality of life\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nside effect\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nvomiting\r\noneil implant\r\nprodetoxon\r\nvivitrol\r\nwedgewood implant","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lobmaier P P, Kunøe N, Gossop M, and Waal H (2011) Naltrexone depot formulations for opioid and alcohol dependence: A systematic review.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate: (1) the efficacy of extended-release (ER) tramadol in treating prescription opioid withdrawal and (2) whether cessation of ER tramadol produces opioid withdrawal. Methods: Prescription opioid users with current opioid dependence and observed withdrawal participated in this inpatient, two-phase double blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. In Phase 1 (days 1-7), participants were randomly assigned to matched oral placebo or ER tramadol (200 or 600. mg daily). In Phase 2 (days 8-13), all participants underwent double blind crossover to placebo. Breakthrough withdrawal medications were available for all subjects. Enrollment continued until 12 completers/group was achieved. Results: Use of breakthrough withdrawal medication differed significantly (p< 0.05) among groups in both phases; the 200. mg group received the least amount in Phase 1, and the 600. mg group received the most in both phases. In Phase 1, tramadol 200. mg produced significantly lower peak ratings than placebo on ratings of insomnia, lacrimation, muscular tension, and sneezing. Only tramadol 600. mg produced miosis in Phase 1. In Phase 2, tramadol 600. mg produced higher peak ratings of rhinorrhea, irritable, depressed, heavy/sluggish, and hot/cold flashes than placebo. There were no serious adverse events and no signal of abuse liability for tramadol. Conclusions: ER tramadol 200. mg modestly attenuated opioid withdrawal. Mild opioid withdrawal occurred after cessation of treatment with 600. mg tramadol. These data support the continued investigation of tramadol as a treatment for opioid withdrawal. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Comments":"2013-10-15","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lofwall M R; Babalonis S ; Nuzzo P A; Siegel A ; Campbell C ; Walsh S L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.05.010","Keywords":"NCT00980044\r\nhydrocortisone\r\nplacebo\r\ntramadol\r\nabdominal pain\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical feature\r\ncontrolled drug release\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncrossover procedure\r\ndepression\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug cost\r\ndrug dose comparison\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug response\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nsustained drug release\r\nfemale\r\nflank pain\r\ngroup B streptococcal infection\r\nhot flush\r\nhuman\r\ninsomnia\r\nirritability\r\nlacrimation\r\nmale\r\nmuscle tone\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\nphase 1 clinical trial\r\nphase 2 clinical trial\r\nprescription\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrash\r\nrhinorrhea\r\nsneezing\r\nsore throat\r\ntachycardia\r\nthorax pain\r\nurine retention\r\nwithdrawal syndrome\r\nultram er","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lofwall M R, Babalonis S, Nuzzo P A, Siegel A, Campbell C, and Walsh S L (2013) Efficacy of extended-release tramadol for treatment of prescription opioid withdrawal: A two-phase randomized controlled trial.

This proof-of-concept study examined the potential efficacy of a CB1 receptor partial agonist, dronabinol, in relieving signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Methods: Twelve opioid dependent adults participated in this 5-week, inpatient, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Volunteers were maintained on double-blind oxycodone (30 mg oral, four times/day) and participated in a training session followed by 7 experimental sessions, each testing a single oral test dose (placebo, oxycodone 30 and 60 mg, dronabinol 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg [decreased from 40 mg]). Placebo was substituted for oxycodone maintenance doses for 21 h before each session in order to produce measurable opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included observer- and participant-ratings of opioid agonist, opioid withdrawal and psychomotor/cognitive performance. Results: Oxycodone produced prototypic opioid agonist effects (i.e. suppressing withdrawal and increasing subjective effects indicative of abuse liability). Dronabinol 5 and 10 mg produced effects most similar to placebo, while the 20 and 30 mg doses produced modest signals of withdrawal suppression that were accompanied by dose-related increases in high, sedation, bad effects, feelings of heart racing, and tachycardia. Dronabinol was not liked more than placebo, showed some impairment in cognitive performance, and was identified as marijuana with increasing dose. Conclusion: CB1 receptor activation is a reasonable strategy to pursue for the treatment of opioid withdrawal; however, dronabinol is not a likely candidate given its modest withdrawal suppression effects of limited duration and previously reported tachycardia during opioid withdrawal.","Comments":"2016-06-09","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lofwall M R; Babalonis S ; Nuzzo P A; Elayi S C; Walsh S L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.05.002","Keywords":"cannabinoid 1 receptor\r\ncannabis\r\ndronabinol\r\nopiate\r\noxycodone\r\nplacebo\r\nadult\r\nanxiety\r\narticle\r\nbackache\r\nclinical article\r\ncognitive defect\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndisease exacerbation\r\ndose response\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug dose comparison\r\ndrug dose reduction\r\ndrug effect\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nepiphora\r\neye disease\r\nfemale\r\nhospital patient\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmale\r\nmuscle disease\r\nmuscle tone\r\nnervousness\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npanic\r\npriority journal\r\npsychomotor performance\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nrhinorrhea\r\nrunny eye\r\nrunny eye\r\nsedation\r\nside effect\r\nsinus tachycardia\r\ntachycardia\r\nvisual analog scale\r\nwithdrawal syndrome\r\nyawning\r\nmarinol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lofwall M R, Babalonis S, Nuzzo P A, Elayi S C, and Walsh S L (2016) Opioid withdrawal suppression efficacy of oral dronabinol in opioid dependent humans.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment involving novel weekly and monthly subcutaneous (SC) buprenorphine depot formulations is noninferior to a daily sublingual (SL) combination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride in the treatment of opioid use disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This outpatient, double-blind, double-dummy randomized clinical trial was conducted at 35 sites in the United States from December 29, 2015, through October 19, 2016. Participants were treatment-seeking adults with moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to daily SL placebo and weekly (first 12 weeks; phase 1) and monthly (last 12 weeks; phase 2) SC buprenorphine (SC-BPN group) or to daily SL buprenorphine with naloxone (24 weeks) with matched weekly and monthly SC placebo injections (SL-BPN/NX group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points tested for noninferiority were response rate (10% margin) and the mean proportion of opioid-negative urine samples for 24 weeks (11% margin). Responder status was defined as having no evidence of illicit opioid use for at least 8 of 10 prespecified points during weeks 9 to 24, with 2 of these at week 12 and during month 6 (weeks 21-24). The mean proportion of samples with no evidence of illicit opioid use (weeks 4-24) evaluated by a cumulative distribution function (CDF) was an a priori secondary outcome with planned superiority testing if the response rate demonstrated noninferiority. RESULTS: A total of 428 participants (263 men [61.4%] and 165 women [38.6%]; mean [SD] age, 38.4 [11.0] years) were randomized to the SL-BPN/NX group (n = 215) or the SC-BPN group (n = 213). The response rates were 31 of 215 (14.4%) for the SL-BPN/NX group and 37 of 213 (17.4%) for the SC-BPN group, a 3.0% difference (95% CI, -4.0% to 9.9%; P < .001). The proportion of opioid-negative urine samples was 1099 of 3870 (28.4%) for the SL-BPN/NX group and 1347 of 3834 (35.1%) for the SC-BPN group, a 6.7% difference (95% CI, -0.1% to 13.6%; P < .001). The CDF for the SC-BPN group (26.7%) was statistically superior to the CDF for the SL-BPN/NX group (0; P = .004). Injection site adverse events (none severe) occurred in 48 participants (22.3%) in the SL-BPN/NX group and 40 (18.8%) in the SC-BPN group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Compared with SL buprenorphine, depot buprenorphine did not result in an inferior likelihood of being a responder or having urine test results negative for opioids and produced superior results on the CDF of no illicit opioid use. These data suggest that depot buprenorphine is efficacious and may have advantages.

Whilst access to and provision of healthcare for people living in prison are mandated by international human rights standards, many opioid dependent people living in prison continue to lack access to opioid substitution treatment (OST) during incarceration, and face uncertainties of continuity of care beyond the prison gate. Methods: A scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley's framework mapped what is currently known about the continuity of OST post-release in Southeast Asia, with a focus on the three countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam) that provide OST in at least one prison. A multi-lingual systematic search (English, Malay, Indonesian, Vietnamese) on Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library collected and reviewed extant relevant published empirical and grey literature including government reports between 2011 and 2021. Of the 365 records found, 18 were eligible for inclusion following removal of duplicates and application of exclusion criteria. These records were charted and thematically analysed. Results: Three main themes were generated: Facilitators of post release continuity of care, Barriers to post release continuity of care and Therapeutic considerations supporting post release continuity of care. When individual and structural gaps exist, disruptions to continuity of OST care post release are observed. Adequate methadone dosage of >80mg/day appears significantly associated with retention in post-release OST. Conclusions: The review highlights the facilitators, barriers and therapeutic considerations of continuity of care of OST between prison and community for people living in prisons from Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Improving community services with family support are key to supporting continued OST adherence post release along with reducing societal stigma towards people who use drugs and those entering or leaving prison. Further efforts are warranted to ensure parity, quality and continuity of OST care post release.","Comments":"2023-07-05","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Loh D A; Plugge E ; Van Hout M C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2023.103957","Keywords":"methadone\r\ncommunity\r\ncommunity reintegration\r\ncorrectional facility\r\ndrug effect\r\nfamily support\r\ngovernment\r\ngrey literature\r\nhuman\r\nIndonesia\r\nMalay-Indonesian\r\nMalaysia\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nparity\r\npractice guideline\r\nreview\r\nsocial welfare\r\nSoutheast Asia\r\nstigma\r\nsystematic review\r\nViet Nam","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Loh D A, Plugge E, and Van Hout M C (2023) Continuity of opioid substitution treatment between prison and community in Southeast Asia: A scoping review.

Within a randomized controlled experiment, 45 patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy were assigned to either IPS or a 6-month waitlist. The waitlist group received IPS after 6 months. The primary outcome assessed over 1 year compared the attainment of a job for the IPS condition to the waitlist comparison group. During the first 6 months after enrollment, 11 (50%) active IPS participants gained competitive employment compared to 1 (5%) waitlist participant (Χ (2) = 12.0, p < 0.001). Over 12 months of enrollment, 11 (50%) IPS participants gained competitive employment compared to 5 (22%) waitlist participants (Χ (2) = 3.92, p = 0.07).

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) frequently encounter barriers accessing and remaining on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some studies have suggested that opioid substitution therapy (OST) could facilitate PWID's engagement with HIV services. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of concurrent OST use on ART-related outcomes among HIV-infected PWID. Methods. We searched Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Social Policy and Practice databases for studies between 1996 to November 2014 documenting the impact of OST, compared to no OST, on ART outcomes. Outcomes considered were coverage and recruitment onto ART, adherence, viral suppression, attrition from ART, and mortality. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects modeling, and heterogeneity assessed using Cochran Q test and I2 statistic. Results. We identified 4685 articles, and 32 studies conducted in North America, Europe, Indonesia, and China were included. OST was associated with a 69% increase in recruitment onto ART (hazard ratio [HR], 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.15), a 54% increase in ART coverage (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.17-2.03), a 2-fold increase in adherence (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.41-3.26), and a 23% decrease in the odds of attrition (OR, 0.77; 95% CI,. 63-.95). OST was associated with a 45% increase in odds of viral suppression (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.21-1.73), but there was limited evidence from 6 studies for OST decreasing mortality for PWID on ART (HR, 0.91; 95% CI,. 65-1.25). Conclusions. These findings support the use of OST, and its integration with HIV services, to improve the HIV treatment and care continuum among HIV-infected PWID.","Comments":"2019-09-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Low A J; Mburu G ; Welton N J; May M T; Davies C F; French C ; Turner K M; Looker K J; Christensen H ; McLean S ; Rhodes T ; Platt L ; Hickman M ; Guise A ; Vickerman P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/cid/ciw416","Keywords":"antiretrovirus agent\r\nantiretroviral therapy\r\nantiviral therapy\r\narticle\r\nCD4 lymphocyte count\r\nChina\r\nEurope\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nIndonesia\r\nintravenous drug abuse\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmortality\r\nNorth America\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\noutcome assessment\r\npatient care\r\npatient compliance\r\npriority journal\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment withdrawal\r\nvirus inhibition","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Low A J, Mburu G, Welton N J, May M T, Davies C F, French C, Turner K M, Looker K J, Christensen H, McLean S, Rhodes T, Platt L, Hickman M, Guise A, and Vickerman P (2016) Impact of Opioid Substitution Therapy on Antiretroviral Therapy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP) is an effective treatment of opioid dependence that may be used in routine medical settings. OBJECTIVE: To compare clinic-based treatment with BUP (clinic-based BUP) with case management and referral to an opioid treatment program (referred treatment). DESIGN: Single-center, 12-month randomized trial. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignments. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00130819) SETTING: HIV clinic in Baltimore, Maryland. PATIENTS: 93 HIV-infected, opioid-dependent participants who were not receiving opioid agonist therapy and were not dependent on alcohol or benzodiazepines. INTERVENTION: Clinic-based BUP included BUP induction and dose titration, urine drug testing, and individual counseling. Referred treatment included case management and referral to an opioid-treatment program. MEASUREMENTS: Initiation and long-term receipt of opioid agonist therapy, urine drug test results, visit attendance with primary HIV care providers, use of antiretroviral therapy, and changes in HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts. RESULTS: The average estimated participation in opioid agonist therapy was 74% (95% CI, 61% to 84%) for clinic-based BUP and 41% (CI, 29% to 53%) for referred treatment (P < 0.001). Positive test results for opioids and cocaine were significantly less frequent in clinic-based BUP than in referred treatment, and study participants receiving clinic-based BUP attended significantly more HIV primary care visits than those receiving referred treatment. Use of antiretroviral therapy and changes in HIV RNA levels and CD4 cell counts did not differ between the 2 groups. LIMITATION: This was a small single-center study, follow-up was only moderate, and the study groups were unbalanced in terms of recent drug injections at baseline. CONCLUSION: Management of HIV-infected, opioid-dependent patients with a clinic-based BUP strategy facilitates access to opioid agonist therapy and improves outcomes of substance abuse treatment.

Opiate-substitution treatment (OST) is the major treatment in community for opioid dependence worldwide. We aimed to estimate crude mortality rates (CMRs) and the effects of OST on mortality risk by meta-analysis. Methods We searched PubMed and Embase databases for articles that were published until Sept 30, 2016 with a combination of terms including “opiate substitution treatment”, “substitution or maintenance”, “methadone or buprenorphine”, “mortality”, and “longitudinal or cohort studies”. We restricted the search to articles written in English. We assessed the CMRs and relative risks (RR) for different OST status. We did subgroup analysis and meta-regression to determine the effect of treatment period, drug type, and drug dose on mortality. Findings 29 longitudinal cohort studies involving 395 055 participants (1 611 377.8 person-years) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. From 22 studies, the pooled all-cause CMRs of opioids users were 0.90 per 100 personyears (95% CI 0.77-1.02) while receiving OST, 1.63 (1.41-1.84) after cessation of OST, and 4.91 (3.52-6.30) for an untreated period. On the basis of ten studies, the pooled overdose CMRs were 0.18 (0.16-0.20) while receiving OST, 0.76 (0.52-1.00) after cessation of OST, and 2.02 (1.30-2.74) for an untreated period. Compared with patients receiving OST, untreated participants had higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR 2.48; 95% CI 1.73-3.54) and overdose mortality (6.60; 4.73-9.21), and participants discharged from OST had a higher risk for all-cause mortality (2.27; 1.99-2.59) and a higher risk of fatal overdose (3.76; 2.24-6.30). The risk of death was greatest in the first 2 weeks after discharge from OST (all-cause CMR 4.71; 95% CI 1.69-7.73). We found evidence that buprenorphine was associated with a lower mortality risk than methadone after terminating OST (0.81; 0.70-0.93). We found no difference of mortality risk to be associated with different types and dosages of substitution medication. Interpretation OST could decrease mortality risk in opioids users, especially death from drug overdose. The findings highlight the importance of OST in the prevention of premature death among opioids users. Prevention of discharge from OST and post-treatment follow-up should be encouraged to reduce mortality.","Comments":"2018-04-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ma J ; Wang R J; Su M F; Liu M X; Shi J ; Lu L ; Bao Y P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\nall cause mortality\r\ncohort analysis\r\nconference abstract\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndrug overdose\r\nEmbase\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nMedline\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmortality rate\r\nmortality risk\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nprevention\r\nrisk assessment\r\nrisk factor\r\nsubstitution reaction\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ma J, Wang R J, Su M F, Liu M X, Shi J, Lu L, and Bao Y P (2017) Effects of opiate substitution treatment on mortality for opioids users: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the primary treatment for opioid dependence. We comprehensively assessed the effects of different MAT-related characteristics on mortality among those with OUD by a systematic review and meta-analysis. The all-cause and overdose crude mortality rates (CMRs) and relative risks (RRs) by treatment status, different type, period, and dose of medication, and retention time were pooled using random effects, subgroup analysis, and meta-regression. Thirty cohort studies involving 370,611 participants (1,378,815 person-years) were eligible in the meta-analysis. From 21 studies, the pooled all-cause CMRs were 0.92 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.79–1.04) while receiving MAT, 1.69 (1.47–1.91) after cessation, and 4.89 (3.54–6.23) for untreated period. Based on 16 studies, the pooled overdose CMRs were 0.24 (0.20–0.28) while receiving MAT, 0.68 (0.55–0.80) after cessation of MAT, and 2.43 (1.72–3.15) for untreated period. Compared with patients receiving MAT, untreated participants had higher risk of all-cause mortality (RR 2.56 [95% CI: 1.72–3.80]) and overdose mortality (8.10 [4.48–14.66]), and discharged participants had higher risk of all-cause death (2.33 [2.02–2.67]) and overdose death (3.09 [2.37–4.01]). The all-cause CMRs during and after opioid substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine were 0.93 (0.76–1.10) and 1.79 (1.47–2.10), and corresponding estimate for antagonist naltrexone treatment were 0.26 (0–0.59) and 1.97 (0–5.18), respectively. Retention in MAT of over 1-year was associated with a lower mortality rate than that with retention ≤1 year (1.62, 1.31–1.93 vs. 5.31, −0.09–10.71). Improved coverage and adherence to MAT and post-treatment follow-up are crucial to reduce the mortality. Long-acting naltrexone showed positive advantage on prevention of premature death among persons with OUD.","Comments":"2018-06-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ma J ; Bao Y P; Wang R J; Su M F; Liu M X; Li J Q; Degenhardt L ; Farrell M ; Blow F C; Ilgen M ; Shi J ; Lu L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41380-018-0094-5","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nall cause mortality\r\narticle\r\ncrude mortality rate\r\ndrug dependence treatment\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nfollow up\r\nhigh risk population\r\nhuman\r\nmedication assisted treatment\r\nmedication compliance\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmortality\r\nmortality risk\r\nopiate addiction\r\npremature mortality\r\npriority journal\r\nprotection\r\nretention time\r\nrisk factor\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ma J, Bao Y P, Wang R J, Su M F, Liu M X, Li J Q, Degenhardt L, Farrell M, Blow F C, Ilgen M, Shi J, and Lu L (2019) Effects of medication-assisted treatment on mortality among opioids users: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective published and unpublished observational studies. Data sources: Search of Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library from the earliest year to 2011 without language restriction. Review methods: We selected studies that directly assessed the impact of opiate substitution treatment in relation to incidence of HIV and studies that assessed incidence of HIV in people who inject drugs and that might have collected data regarding exposure to opiate substitution treatment but not have reported it. Authors of these studies were contacted. Data were extracted by two reviewers and pooled in a meta-analysis with a random effects model. Results: Twelve published studies that examined the impact of opiate substitution treatment on HIV transmission met criteria for inclusion, and unpublished data were obtained from three additional studies. All included studies examined methadone maintenance treatment. Data from nine of these studies could be pooled, including 819 incident HIV infections over 23 608 person years of follow-up. Opiate substitution treatment was associated with a 54% reduction in risk of HIV infection among people who inject drugs (rate ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.67; P<0.001). There was evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I2=60%, χ2=20.12, P=0.010), which could not be explained by geographical region, site of recruitment, or the provision of incentives. There was weak evidence for greater benefit associated with longer duration of exposure to opiate substitution treatment. Conclusion: Opiate substitution treatment provided as maintenance therapy is associated with a reduction in the risk of HIV infection among people who inject drugs. These findings, however, could reflect comparatively high levels of motivation to change behaviour and reduce injecting risk behaviour among people who inject drugs who are receiving opiate substitution treatment.","Comments":"2012-11-07","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"MacArthur G J; Minozzi S ; Martin N ; Vickerman P ; Deren S ; Bruneau J ; Degenhardt L ; Hickman M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.e5945","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\nbehavior change\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ndetoxification\r\nfollow up\r\nhigh risk behavior\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nincidence\r\ninfection prevention\r\ninfection risk\r\nintravenous drug abuse\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npriority journal\r\nreview\r\nrisk reduction\r\nsystematic review\r\nvirus transmission","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"MacArthur G J, Minozzi S, Martin N, Vickerman P, Deren S, Bruneau J, Degenhardt L, and Hickman M (2012) Opiate substitution treatment and HIV transmission in people who inject drugs: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Prevention of these infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) is critical to reduce ongoing transmission, morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A review of reviews was undertaken involving systematic literature searches of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, IBSS and the Cochrane Library (2000-2011) to identify English language reviews regarding the effectiveness of harm reduction interventions in relation to HIV transmission, HCV transmission and injecting risk behaviour (IRB). Interventions included needle and syringe programmes (NSP); the provision of injection paraphernalia; opiate substitution treatment (OST); information, education and counselling (IEC); and supervised injecting facilities (SIFs). Reviews were classified into 'core' or 'supplementary' using critical appraisal criteria, and the strength of review-level evidence was assessed. RESULTS: Twelve core and thirteen supplementary reviews were included. From these reviews we identified: (i) for NSP: tentative review-level evidence to support effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, insufficient review-level evidence relating to HCV transmission, but sufficient review-level evidence in relation to IRB; (ii) for OST: sufficient review-level evidence of effectiveness in relation to HIV transmission and IRB, but tentative review-level evidence in relation to HCV transmission; (iii) for IEC, the provision of injection paraphernalia and SIFs: tentative review-level evidence of effectiveness in reducing IRB; and either insufficient or no review-level evidence for these interventions in relation to HIV or HCV transmission. CONCLUSION: Review-level evidence indicates that harm reduction interventions can reduce IRB, with evidence strongest for OST and NSP. However, there is comparatively little review-level evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in preventing HCV transmission among PWID. Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and impact of scaling up comprehensive packages of harm reduction interventions to minimise HIV and HCV transmission among PWID.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"MacArthur GJ ; van Velzen E ; Palmateer N ; Kimber J ; Pharris A ; Hope V ; Taylor A ; Roy K ; Aspinall E ; Goldberg D ; Rhodes T ; Hedrich D ; Salminen M ; Hickman M ; Hutchinson SJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2013.07.001 ","Keywords":"HIV Infections/complications/*prevention & control\r\n*Harm Reduction\r\nHepatitis C/complications/*prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nNeedle-Exchange Programs\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nRisk-Taking\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*complications/prevention & control/psychology\r\nHIV\r\nHarm reduction\r\nHepatitis C\r\nPeople who inject drugs\r\nReview","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"MacArthur GJ, van Velzen E, Palmateer N, Kimber J, Pharris A, Hope V, Taylor A, Roy K, Aspinall E, Goldberg D, Rhodes T, Hedrich D, Salminen M, Hickman M, and Hutchinson SJ (2014) Interventions to prevent HIV and Hepatitis C in people who inject drugs: a review of reviews to assess evidence of effectiveness..

This rapid review synthesizes evidence on current barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine/naloxone and naltrexone at the patient, provider, and system levels to inform future interventions aimed at expanding treatment. Methods: We systematically searched numerous bibliographic databases through May 2020 and selected studies published since 2014. Study selection, data abstraction, coding of barriers and facilitators, and quality assessment were first completed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Results: We included 40 studies of buprenorphine (5 also discussed naltrexone). Four types of patient and provider-level barriers to OUD medication use emerged—stigma related to OUD medications, treatment experiences and beliefs (positive or negative), logistical issues (time and costs as well as insurance and regulatory requirements), and knowledge (high or low) of OUD and the role of medications. Stigma was the most common barrier among patients, while logistical issues were the most common barriers among providers. Facilitators for both patients and providers included peer supports. Most administrator-identified or system-level barriers and facilitators fit into the category of logistical issues. We have moderate confidence in buprenorphine findings but low confidence in naltrexone findings due to the small number of studies. Discussion: Stigma, treatment experiences, logistical issues, and knowledge gaps are the main barriers associated with low utilization of OUD medications. These barriers can overlap and mutually reinforce each other, but given that, it is plausible that reducing one barrier may lead to reductions in others. The highest priority for future research is to evaluate interventions to reduce stigma. Other priorities for future research include better identification of barriers and facilitators for specific populations, such as those with OUD related to prescription opioids, and for naltrexone use.

This study provides a systematic review of prejudice and discrimination toward MOUD, a form of \"intervention stigma,\" or stigma associated with a particular medical treatment. A systematic search strategy was used in PsychInfo and PubMed to identify studies published between 1998 and 2018. Studies that empirically examined stigma toward MOUD were included if the manuscript was of moderate or high quality. Studies were analyzed using thematic synthesis. The search yielded 972 studies, of which 28 were included. Most studies utilized qualitative methods to examine intervention stigma toward methadone or buprenorphine, with one including naltrexone. Studies demonstrated that intervention stigma among healthcare providers was influenced by lack of training and abstinent treatment preferences. Providers equated MOUD with illicit substance use and at times refused to care for MOUD patients. Stigma among peer patients seeking treatment was also influenced by abstinent treatment preferences, and among the general public stigma was influenced by lack of MOUD knowledge. Intervention stigma was also driven at the policy level by high regulation of methadone, which fueled diversion and hindered social functioning among patients. Few studies indicated how to reduce intervention stigma toward MOUD. Intervention stigma affects both provision and perceptions of methadone and buprenorphine, decreasing access and utilization of MOUD. Future research should further develop and test MOUD stigma reduction interventions in a variety of social contexts to improve access to care and reduce patient barriers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Madden EF ; Prevedel S ; Light T ; Sulzer SH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10826084.2021.1975749 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nStigma\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nmedications for addiction treatment\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid use disorder\r\npharmacotherapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Madden EF, Prevedel S, Light T, and Sulzer SH (2021) Intervention Stigma toward Medications for Opioid Use Disorder: A Systematic Review..

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, comparative multi-centre study with parallel groups. SETTING: Three psychiatric hospitals in Austria specializing in in-patient detoxification. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female opioid dependents (age > 18 years) willing to undergo detoxification from maintenance therapy in order to reach abstinence. INTERVENTIONS: Abstinence was reached from maintenance treatment by tapered dose reduction of either SROM or methadone over a period of 16 days. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analyses were based on the number of patients per treatment group completing the study, as well as on the control of signs and symptoms of withdrawal [measured using Short Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS)] and suppression of opiate craving. In addition, self-reported somatic and psychic symptoms (measured using Symptom Checklist SCL-90-R) were monitored. FINDINGS: Of the 208 patients enrolled into the study, 202 were eligible for analysis (SROM: n = 102, methadone: n = 100). Completion rates were 51% in the SROM group and 49% in the methadone group [difference between groups: 2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -12% to 16%]. The rate of discontinuation in the study was high mainly because of patients voluntarily withdrawing from treatment. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found in terms of signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal, craving for opiates or self-reported symptoms. SROM and methadone were both well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Detoxification from maintenance treatment with tapered dose reduction of SROM is non-inferior to methadone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Madlung-Kratzer E ; Spitzer B ; Brosch R ; Dunkel D ; Haring C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02653.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage\r\nMorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotics/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*prevention & control\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Madlung-Kratzer E, Spitzer B, Brosch R, Dunkel D, and Haring C (2009) A double-blind, randomized, parallel group study to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of slow-release oral morphine versus methadone in opioid-dependent in-patients willing to undergo detoxification..

Additionally, clinicians should be aware of these inequities in the treatment of patients. METHODS: We carried out a scoping review of the literature regarding health inequities in treatment for OUD in July 2022. The study team retrieved articles published between 2016 and 2021 from MEDLINE and Ovid Embase. After authors received training, screening and data extraction were performed in masked, duplicate fashion. The team screened a total of 3673 titles and abstracts, followed by 172 articles for full-text review. The inequities that we examined were race/ethnicity, sex or gender, income, under-resourced/rural, occupational status, education level, and LGBTQ+. We used Stata 17.0 (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, TX) to summarize data and statistics of the studies within our sample. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies evaluating inequities in OUD treatment met inclusion criteria. The most common inequity that studies examined was race/ethnicity (34/44 [77.27 %] studies), followed by under-resourced/rural (19/44 [43.18 %] studies), and sex or gender (18/44 [40.91 %] studies). LGBTQ+ (0/44 [0.0 %] studies) was not reported in the included studies. Our results indicate that many historically marginalized populations experience inequities related to access and outcomes in OUD treatment. The included studies in our scoping review occasionally demonstrated inconsistent findings. CONCLUSIONS: Gaps exist within the literature on health inequities in treatment for OUD. The most examined inequities were race/ethnicity, under-resourced/rural and sex or gender, while studies did not examine LGBTQ+ status. Future research should aim to advance and supplement literature investigating health inequities in OUD treatment to ensure inclusive, patient-centered care.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Magee T ; Peters C ; Jacobsen SM ; Nees D ; Dunford B ; Ford AI ; Vassar M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.josat.2023.209082 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Drug Overdose/drug therapy\r\nPatient-Centered Care\r\nHealth inequities\r\nOUD treatment\r\nOpioid dependence\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nSubstance use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Magee T, Peters C, Jacobsen SM, Nees D, Dunford B, Ford AI, and Vassar M (2023) Inequities in the treatment of opioid use disorder: A scoping review..

Five databases were searched from inception to July 2017 to identify English-language controlled trials, case control studies, and cohort comparisons of one or more groups; cross-sectional studies were excluded. Two independent reviewers screened identified literature, abstracted study-level information, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analyses used the Hartung-Knapp method for random-effects models. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. A comprehensive search followed by 1411 full text publication screenings yielded 30 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 observational studies meeting inclusion criteria. The studies reported highly diverse functional outcome measures. Only one RCT was rated as high quality, but several methodologically sound observational studies were identified. The statistical power to detect differences in functional outcomes was unclear in most studies. When compared with matched “healthy” controls with no history of substance use disorder (SUD), in two studies MAT patients had significantly poorer working memory and cognitive speed. One study found MAT patients scored worse in aggressive responding than did “healthy” controls. A large observational study found that MAT users had twice the odds of involvement in an injurious traffic accident as non-users. When compared with persons with OUD not on MAT, one cohort study found lower fatigue rates among buprenorphine-treated OUD patients. No differences were reported for occupational outcomes and results for criminal activity and other social/behavioral areas were mixed. There were few differences among MAT drug types. A pooled analysis of three RCTs found a significantly lower prevalence of fatigue with buprenorphine compared to methadone, while a meta-analysis of the same RCTs found no statistical difference in insomnia prevalence. Three RCTs that focused on cognitive function compared the effects of buprenorphine to methadone; no statistically significant differences in memory, cognitive speed and flexibility, attention, or vision were reported. The quality of evidence for most functional outcomes was rated low or very low. In sum, weaknesses in the body of evidence prevent strong conclusions about the effects of MAT for opioid use disorder on functional outcomes. Rigorous studies of functional effects would strengthen the body of literature.","Comments":"2018-04-19","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maglione M A; Raaen L ; Chen C ; Azhar G ; Shahidinia N ; Shen M ; Maksabedian E ; Shanman R M; Newberry S ; Hempel S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2018.03.001","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\narticle\r\nattention\r\nbody equilibrium\r\ncognition\r\ncrime\r\ndrug dependence\r\ndrug therapy\r\nevidence based medicine\r\nfatigue\r\nfunctional assessment\r\nhuman\r\ninsomnia\r\nmedical history\r\nmedication assisted treatment\r\nmemory\r\nneurology\r\noccupation\r\nopiate addiction\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreturn to work\r\nsocial behavior\r\nsystematic review\r\ntherapy effect\r\ntraffic accident\r\nvision\r\nworking memory","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maglione M A, Raaen L, Chen C, Azhar G, Shahidinia N, Shen M, Maksabedian E, Shanman R M, Newberry S, and Hempel S (2018) Effects of medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder on functional outcomes: A systematic review.

Although MAT patients performed significantly better on some functional outcomes than persons with OUD who did not receive MAT, MAT patients performed worse on several cognitive measures than did matched \"healthy\" controls with no history of substance use disorder (SUD) or OUD. Because of the moderate-to-high risk of bias of most studies, quality of evidence is low or very low for all findings. The small number of studies reporting on outcomes of interest and the weaknesses in the body of evidence prevent making strong conclusions about MAT effects on functional outcomes. The literature shows that more research is needed that targets functional outcomes specifically, and there is, in particular, a lack of research evaluating potential differences in functional effects among medication types, the route of administration, treatment modality, and length of treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Maglione MA ; Laura R ; Christine C ; Azhar GS ; Nima S ; Mimi S ; Hernandez EJM ; Shanman RM ; Susanne H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Military Health and Health Care\r\nOpioids\r\nPharmaceutical Drugs\r\nSubstance Abuse Treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maglione MA, Laura R, Christine C, Azhar GS, Nima S, Mimi S, Hernandez EJM, Shanman RM, and Susanne H (2020) Effects of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Opioid Use Disorder on Functional Outcomes: A Systematic Review..

We critically review recent literature on tele-MOUD and synthesize studies reporting primary data under four themes: clinical effectiveness, non-clinical effectiveness, perceptions, and regulatory considerations. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite increasing publications, most failed to include long-term comprehensive assessments. Findings indicate favorable outcomes such as improvements in retention and abstinence rates, positive experiences, and improved feasibility with the relaxation of regulatory measures. With increased adoption, clinician and patient perceptions appeared largely positive. Negative findings, albeit minor, were primarily associated with workflow adaptation difficulties and limited access of underserved populations to technology and internet connection. Additional financial, logistical, outreach, and training support for clinicians, patients, and support staff is recommended, in addition to permanent evidence-based regulatory reforms, to scale and optimize tele-MOUD services. Comprehensive recommendations to overcome limitations are expanded therein.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mahmoud H ; Naal H ; Whaibeh E ; Smith A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s11920-022-01346-z ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*COVID-19\r\nHumans\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPandemics\r\n*Telemedicine\r\nCOVID-19\r\nMedication-assisted treatment\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nTelebehavioral health\r\nTelehealth","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mahmoud H, Naal H, Whaibeh E, and Smith A (2022) Telehealth-Based Delivery of Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder: a Critical Review of Recent Developments..

People with opioid use disorder (OUD) are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and at higher risk for opioid-related mortality. However, correctional facilities frequently adopt an abstinence-only approach, seldom offering the gold standard opioid agonist treatment (OAT) to incarcerated persons with OUD. In an attempt to inform adequate management of OUD among incarcerated persons, we conducted a systematic review of opioid-related interventions delivered before, during, and after incarceration. Methods and findings We systematically reviewed 8 electronic databases for original, peer-reviewed literature published between January 2008 and October 2019. Our review included studies conducted among adult participants with OUD who were incarcerated or recently released into the community (<90 days post-incarceration). The search identified 2,356 articles, 46 of which met the inclusion criteria based on assessments by 2 independent reviewers. Thirty studies were conducted in North America, 9 in Europe, and 7 in Asia/Oceania. The systematic review included 22 randomized control trials (RCTs), 3 non-randomized clinical trials, and 21 observational studies. Eight observational studies utilized administrative data and included large sample sizes (median of 10,419 [range 2273-131,472] participants), and 13 observational studies utilized primary data, with a median of 140 (range 27-960) participants. RCTs and non-randomized clinical trials included a median of 198 (range 15-1,557) and 44 (range 27-382) participants, respectively. Twelve studies included only men, 1 study included only women, and in the remaining 33 studies, the percentage of women was below 30%. The majority of study participants were middle-aged adults (36-55 years). Participants treated at a correctional facility with methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) or buprenorphine (BPN)/naloxone (NLX) had lower rates of illicit opioid use, had higher adherence to OUD treatment, were less likely to be re-incarcerated, and were more likely to be working 1 year post-incarceration. Participants who received MMT or BPN/NLX while incarcerated had fewer nonfatal overdoses and lower mortality. The main limitation of our systematic review is the high heterogeneity of studies (different designs, settings, populations, treatments, and outcomes), precluding a meta-analysis. Other study limitations include the insufficient data about incarcerated women with OUD, and the lack of information about incarcerated populations with OUD who are not included in published research. Conclusions In this carefully conducted systematic review, we found that correctional facilities should scale up OAT among incarcerated persons with OUD. The strategy is likely to decrease opioid-related overdose and mortality, reduce opioid use and other risky behaviors during and after incarceration, and improve retention in addiction treatment after prison release. Immediate OAT after prison release and additional preventive strategies such as the distribution of NLX kits to at-risk individuals upon release greatly decrease the occurrence of opioid-related overdose and mortality. In an effort to mitigate the impact of the opioid-related overdose crisis, it is crucial to scale up OAT and opioid-related overdose prevention strategies (e.g., NLX) within a continuum of treatment before, during, and after incarceration.","Comments":"2020-01-31","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Malta M ; Varatharajan T ; Russell C ; Pang M ; Bonato S ; Fischer B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pmed.1003002","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nopiate\r\nopiate agonist\r\narticle\r\ncost effectiveness analysis\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nintoxication\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmortality\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nprisoner\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrisk factor\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Malta M, Varatharajan T, Russell C, Pang M, Bonato S, and Fischer B (2019) Opioid-related treatment, interventions, and outcomes among incarcerated persons: A systematic review.

We decided to evaluate safety and efficacy of VLNTX adjunct to methadone in reducing withdrawal during detoxification. In a multi-center, double-blind, randomized study at community treatment programs, where most detoxifications are performed, 174 opioid-dependent subjects received NTX 0.125 mg, 0.250 mg or placebo daily for 6 days, together with methadone in tapering doses. VLNTX-treated individuals reported attenuated withdrawal symptoms [F = 7.24 (2,170); P = 0.001] and reduced craving [F = 3.73 (2,107); P = 0.03]. Treatment effects were more pronounced at discharge and were not accompanied by a significantly higher retention rate. There were no group differences in use of adjuvant medications and no treatment-related adverse events. Further studies should explore the use of VLNTX, combined with full and partial opioid agonist medications, in detoxification and long-term treatment of opioid dependence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mannelli P ; Patkar AA ; Peindl K ; Gorelick DA ; Wu LT ; Gottheil E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1369-1600.2008.00119.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects\r\nCommunity Mental Health Services/*statistics & numerical data\r\nDisruptive, Impulse Control, and Conduct Disorders/prevention & control\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Inactivation, Metabolic\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nProgram Development\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*etiology/*rehabilitation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mannelli P, Patkar AA, Peindl K, Gorelick DA, Wu LT, and Gottheil E (2009) Very low dose naltrexone addition in opioid detoxification: a randomized, controlled trial..

Despite the uncertain role of opioid withdrawal in predicting successful outcomes, early symptom control may favor detoxification completion. Methods: We explored withdrawal severity and early response to treatment, safety, and clinical measures in 35 adult patients with DSM-5 OUD during a 7-day office-based buprenorphine-naltrexone and ancillary medications transition to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX). Results: Subjective and objective measures of withdrawal intensity improved consistently throughout treatment in the whole sample. Participants who went on to receive XR-NTX (n = 27, 77%) reported a greater attenuation of symptoms by treatment day 2 (r =.595, p =.001), and were less likely to be injection drug users (r = −.501, p =.004). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded in 20% of participants: the majority (n = 6, 85.7%) consisted of single episodes of increased withdrawal which were well controlled using ancillary medications. One serious AE was unrelated to treatment. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Early opioid withdrawal changes may be a useful indicator of treatment response, helping adjust the transition protocol to the individual patients’ need and gather valuable information for a better understanding of the relationship between initiating and remaining in treatment.

Maintenance opioid agonist therapy is the first-line treatment, but many patients do not stop using illicit or non-prescribed drugs concomitantly. We aimed to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a personalised psychosocial intervention implemented with a toolkit of behaviour-change techniques as an adjunct to opioid agonist therapy. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial at a specialist UK National Health Service community addictions clinic in London, UK. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, met criteria for opioid or cocaine dependence, or both, in the past 12 months, and voluntarily sought continued oral maintenance opioid agonist therapy, which they had been prescribed for at least 6 weeks. All participants were treatment resistant (ie, had used illicit or non-prescribed opioids or cocaine on one or more days in the past 28 days at study screening, which was verified by positive urine drug screen). Participants were allocated (1:1) by a web-accessed randomisation sequence (stratified by opioid agonist medication, current cocaine use, and current rug use) to receive a personalised psychosocial intervention (comprising a flexible toolkit of psychological-change methods, including contingency management to reinforce abstinence, recovery activities, and clinic attendance) in addition to treatment as usual, or treatment as usual only (control group). The primary outcome was treatment response at 18 weeks, which was defined as abstinence from illicit and non-prescribed opioids and cocaine in the past 28 days, as measured with treatment outcomes profiles and urine drug screening. Taking a societal cost perspective, we did an evaluation of cost-effectiveness with a wide range of willingness-to-pay values for a unit improvement in the probability of treatment response. We also calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Efficacy was analysed in a modified-intention-to-treat population, including all participants who were randomly allocated but excluding those who had previously completed the intervention. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN69313751. The trial is completed. FINDINGS: Between June 7, 2013, and Dec 21, 2015, we randomly allocated 136 participants to the psychosocial intervention group and 137 to the control group. The trial database was locked on April 19, 2017. Three patients (one in the psychosocial intervention group and two in the control group) who were re-randomised in error were excluded from the analysis. 22 (16%) of 135 patients in the psychosocial intervention group had a treatment response, compared with nine (7%) of 135 in the control group (adjusted log odds 1·20 [95% CI 0·01-2·37]; p=0·048). The psychosocial intervention had a higher probability of being cost-effective than treatment as usual. There was a probability range of 47-87% for willingness-to-pay thresholds of £0-1000 for a unit improvement in the probability of treatment response. QALYs were higher in the psychosocial intervention group than in the control group (mean difference 0·048 [95% CI 0·016-0·080]; p=0·004) in adjusted analyses, with 60% and 67% probabilities of cost-effectiveness at the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's willingness-to-pay thresholds of £20 000 and £30 000 per QALY, respectively. The number of adverse events was similar between groups, and no severe adverse events in either group were judged to be treatment related. One participant in the control group was hospitalised with drug-injection-related sepsis and died. INTERPRETATION: In maintenance opioid agonist therapy, an adjunctive personalised psychosocial intervention in addition to standard therapy was efficacious and cost-effective compared with standard therapy alone at helping treatment-resistant patients abstain from using illicit and non-prescribed opioids and cocaine.

Despite the widespread use of methadone in maintenance treatment for opioid dependence in many countries, it is a controversial treatment whose effectiveness has been disputed. Objectives: To evaluate the effects ofmethadonemaintenance treatment (MMT) compared with treatments that did not involve opioid replacement therapy (i.e., detoxification, offer of drug-free rehabilitation, placebo medication, wait-list controls) for opioid dependence. Search strategy: We searched the following databases up to Dec 2008: the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE, PubMED, CINAHL, Current Contents, Psychlit, CORK [www. state.vt.su/adap/cork], Alcohol and Drug Council of Australia (ADCA) [www.adca.org.au], Australian Drug Foundation (ADF-VIC) [www.adf.org.au], Centre for Education and Information on Drugs and Alcohol (CEIDA) [www.ceida.net.au], Australian Bibliographic Network (ABN), and Library of Congress databases, available NIDA monographs and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence Inc. proceedings, the reference lists of all identified studies and published reviews; authors of identified RCTs were asked about other published or unpublished relevant RCTs. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled clinical trials of methadone maintenance therapy compared with either placebo maintenance or other nonpharmacological therapy for the treatment of opioid dependence. Data collection and analysis: Reviewers evaluated the papers separately and independently, rating methodological quality of sequence generation, concealment of allocation and bias. Data were extracted independently for meta-analysis and double-entered. Main results: Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review, all were randomised clinical trials, two were double-blind. There were a total number of 1969 participants. The sequence generation was inadequate in one study, adequate in five studies and unclear in the remaining studies. The allocation of concealment was adequate in three studies and unclear in the remaining studies. Methadone appeared statistically significantly more effective than non-pharmacological approaches in retaining patients in treatment and in the suppression of heroin use as measured by self report and urine/hair analysis (6 RCTs, RR = 0.66 95%CI 0.56-0.78), but not statistically different in criminal activity (3 RCTs, RR=0.39; 95%CI: 0.12-1.25) or mortality (4 RCTs, RR=0.48; 95%CI: 0.10-2.39). Authors' conclusions: Methadone is an effective maintenance therapy intervention for the treatment of heroin dependence as it retains patients in treatment and decreases heroin use better than treatments that do not utilise opioid replacement therapy. It does not show a statistically significant superior effect on criminal activity or mortality. Copyright © 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, there is moderate quality of evidence that only high-dose buprenorphine (= 16 mg) was more effective than placebo in suppressing illicit opioid use measured by urinanalysis in the trials, 3 studies, 729 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.17; 95% CI -1.85 to -0.49, Notably, low-dose, (2 studies, 487 participants, SMD 0.10; 95% CI -0.80 to 1.01), and medium-dose, (2 studies, 463 participants, SMD -0.08; 95% CI -0.78 to 0.62) buprenorphine did not suppress illicit opioid use measured by urinanalysis better than placebo. There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine in flexible doses adjusted to participant need,was less effective than methadone in retaining participants, 5 studies, 788 participants, RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95. For those retained in treatment, no difference was observed in suppression of opioid use as measured by urinalysis, 8 studies, 1027 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.02 or self report, 4 studies, 501 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.07, with moderate quality of evidence. Consistent with the results in the flexible-dose studies, in low fixed-dose studies, methadone (≤ 40 mg) was more likely to retain participants than low-dose buprenorphine (2 -6 mg), (3 studies, 253 participants, RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.87). However, we found contrary results at medium dose and high dose: there was no difference between medium-dose buprenorphine (7 -15 mg) and medium-dose methadone (40 -85 mg) in retention, (7 studies, 780 participants, RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.10) or in suppression of illicit opioid use as measured by urines, (4 studies, 476 participants, SMD 0.25; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.58) or self report of illicit opioid use, (2 studies, 174 participants, SMD -0.82; 95% CI -1.83 to 0.19). Similarly, there was no difference between high-dose buprenorphine (= 16 mg) and high-dose methadone (= 85 mg) in retention (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.20 to 3.16) or suppression of self-reported heroin use (SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.37) (1 study, 134 participants). Few studies reported adverse events ; two studies compared adverse events statistically, finding no difference between methadone and buprenorphine, except for a single result indicating more sedation among those using methadone. Authors' conclusions: Buprenorphine is an effective medication in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence, retaining people in treatment at any dose above 2 mg, and suppressing illicit opioid use (at doses 16 mg or greater) based on placebo-controlled trials. However, compared to methadone, buprenorphine retains fewer people when doses are flexibly delivered and at low fixed doses. If fixed medium or high doses are used, buprenorphine and methadone appear no different in effectiveness (retention in treatment and suppression of illicit opioid use); however, fixed doses are rarely used in clinical practice so the flexible dose results are more relevant to patient care. Methadone is superior to buprenorphine in retaining people in treatment, and methadone equally suppresses illicit opioid use.","Comments":"2018-02-22","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mattick R P; Breen C ; Kimber J ; Davoli M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD002207.pub4","Keywords":"benzodiazepine\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncocaine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nmorphine\r\nplacebo\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\nclinical evaluation\r\ncriminal behavior\r\ndose response\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug megadose\r\ndrug safety\r\nhuman\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmortality\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsedation\r\nself report\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment planning\r\nurinalysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mattick R P, Breen C, Kimber J, and Davoli M (2014) Buprenorphine maintenance versus placebo or methadone maintenance for opioid dependence.

Quality of evidence: Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched. Consensus reports, guidelines published, and other authoritative sources were also included in this review. Apart from expert guidelines, data included in this review constitute level 1 evidence. Findings: Bup/nx is a partial μ-opioid agonist combined with the opioid antagonist naloxone in a 4:1 ratio. It has a lower abuse potential, carries less stigma, and allows for more flexibility than methadone. Bup/nx is indicated for both inpatient and ambulatory medically assisted withdrawal (acute detoxification) and long-term substitution treatment (maintenance) of patients who have a mild-to-moderate physical dependence. A stepwise long-term substitution treatment with regular monitoring and follow-up assessment is usually preferred, as it has better outcomes in reducing illicit opioid use, minimizing concomitant risks such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C transmission, retaining patients in treatment and improving global functioning. Conclusion: Bup/nx is safe and effective for opioid detoxification and substitution treatment. Its unique pharmaceutical properties make it particularly suitable for office-based maintenance treatment of opioid-use disorder. © 2014 Mauger et al.

In this exploratory analysis, we compared the effectiveness of BUP/NX flexible model of care relative to methadone for craving reduction in individuals with POUD. METHODS: We analyzed data from a multicentric, pragmatic, 24-week open-label randomized controlled trial conducted in participants with POUD (N = 272) who were randomly assigned to BUP/NX model of care with flexible take-home dosing (n = 138) or the standard model of care with closely supervised methadone (n = 134). Treatments were prescribed and administered according to local guidelines, in diverse clinical settings. Craving was measured using the Brief Substance Craving Scale at baseline, week 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22. RESULTS: Cravings decreased in both treatment groups over 22 weeks (BUP/NX adjusted mean difference = -5.52, 95% CI = -6.91 to -4.13; methadone adjusted mean difference = -3.95, 95% CI = -5.28 to -2.63; p < 0.001), and were overall lower in the BUP/NX group (adjusted mean = 4.04, 95% CI = 3.43-4.64) than the methadone group (adjusted mean = 5.13, 95% CI = 4.51-5.74; p < 0.001). The time by treatment group interaction (favoring BUP/NX) was statistically significant at week 2 (adjusted mean difference = -1.58, 95% CI = -3.13 to -0.03; p = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the standard methadone model of care, flexible take-home dosing of BUP/NX was associated with lower craving in individuals with POUD. These findings can contribute to guiding shared decision-making regarding OAT treatment in this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McAnulty C ; Bastien G ; Eugenia Socias M; Bruneau J ; Foll BL ; Lim R ; Brissette S ; Ledjiar O ; Marsan S ; Talbot A ; Jutras-Aswad D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109604 ","Keywords":"*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nCraving\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaloxone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nPrescriptions\r\nBuprenorphine/naloxone\r\nCraving\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid\r\nOpioid-related disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McAnulty C, Bastien G, Eugenia Socias M, Bruneau J, Foll BL, Lim R, Brissette S, Ledjiar O, Marsan S, Talbot A, and Jutras-Aswad D (2022) Buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone effectiveness for reducing craving in individuals with prescription opioid use disorder: Exploratory results from an open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial..

We sought to determine to what extent craving mediated the relationship between opioid agonist therapy and changes in opioid use. METHODS: Data came from a pragmatic, 24-week, pan-Canadian, multi-centric, open-label, randomized controlled trial comparing flexible buprenorphine/naloxone take-home doses to standard supervised methadone models of care for the treatment of prescription-type opioid use disorder. Participants were randomly allocated to buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone models of care. 270 people with prescription-type opioid use disorder were included in analyses. There were 93 women (34.4%) and 2 transgender (0.7%) participants. Most participants were white (67.4%), 45.9% reported unstable living conditions, and 44.8% had psychiatric comorbidities. Generalized linear mixed models followed by mediation analysis estimated the direct effect of treatment group on Timeline Followback-reported next-week opioid use and the indirect effect through past 24-hour opioid craving measured using the Brief Substance Craving Scale at week 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22. RESULTS: Upon mediation analysis, the average direct effect of treatment on opioid use was 0.465 (95 % CI = 0.183 to 0.751, p < 0.001). The average causal mediated effect was 0.144 (95 % CI = 0.021 to 0.110; p < 0.001). Craving accounted for 23.6 % of the effect of treatment on opioid use (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Past 24-hour craving was associated with increased next-week opioid use; however, craving only partially mediated the effect of buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone on next-week opioid use. Research is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of factors mediating opioid use during opioid agonist therapy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McAnulty C ; Bastien G ; Ledjiar O ; Eugenia Socias M; Le Foll B ; Lim R ; Jutras-Aswad D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2024.108023 ","Keywords":"Female\r\nHumans\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nCraving\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nCanada/epidemiology\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/psychology\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nAddiction\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nCraving\r\nDependence\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McAnulty C, Bastien G, Ledjiar O, Eugenia Socias M, Le Foll B, Lim R, and Jutras-Aswad D (2024) Mediating effect of craving on the impact of buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone treatment on opioid use: Results from a randomized controlled trial..

METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched, and reference lists were reviewed to identify additional studies. Studies were eligible if they focused on methadone treatment in office-based settings conducted in the United States or other highly developed countries and reported outcomes (e.g., retention in care). Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized; uncontrolled and descriptive studies were included when stronger evidence was unavailable. One investigator abstracted key information, and a second verified data. A scoping review approach broadly surveyed the evidence, and therefore study quality was not rated formally. RESULTS: Eighteen studies of patients treated with office-based methadone were identified, including six trials, eight observational studies, and four additional articles discussing use of pharmacies to dispense methadone. Studies on office-based methadone treatment, including primary care-based dispensing, were limited but consistently found that stable methadone patients valued office-based care and remained in care with low rates of drug use; outcomes were similar compared with stable patients in regular care. Office-based methadone treatment was associated with higher treatment satisfaction and quality of life. Limitations included underpowered comparisons and small samples. CONCLUSIONS: Limited research suggests that office-based methadone treatment and pharmacy dispensing could enhance access to methadone treatment for patients with opioid use disorder without adversely affecting patient outcomes and, potentially, inform modifications to federal regulations.

METHODS: Studies addressing adolescent and young adult opioid use disorder and treatment with MOUD on patient outcomes (eg, retention in care) were included. Randomized trials and controlled observational studies were prioritized. Investigators extracted key information, summarized findings, noted methodological weaknesses, and tabled the details. RESULTS: The search identified 4 randomized trials (N = 241), 1 systematic review with 52 studies (total N = 125,994), and 5 retrospective analyses of health insurance claims. The trials reported buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone reduced opioid use. Return to use was observed when pharmacotherapy ceased. A systematic review concluded that adolescents and young adults had lower retention in care than older adults. The observational studies found that adolescents were unlikely to receive MOUD. There was some evidence that non-Hispanic Black adolescents and young adults were less likely than non-Hispanic Whites to receive MOUD. CONCLUSIONS: MOUD therapies reduce opioid use among adolescent and young adults but few receive MOUD. MOUD services for adolescents and young adults should be developed and tested. Randomized clinical trials are necessary to develop appropriate clinical guidelines for using MOUD with adolescents and young adults.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McCarty D ; Chan B ; Buchheit BM ; Bougatsos C ; Grusing S ; Chou R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000898 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nHealth Services Accessibility\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McCarty D, Chan B, Buchheit BM, Bougatsos C, Grusing S, and Chou R (2022) Effectiveness of and Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder for Adolescents and Young Adults: A Scoping Review..

Use of XR-NTX among opioid dependent persons leaving jails and prisons is increasing despite scant high-quality evidence regarding XR-NTX's effectiveness at re-entry. METHODS: This 24-week, open-label randomized controlled trial examines the effectiveness of XR-NTX as opioid relapse prevention at release from jail (N=85) compared to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU, N=85). A third, non-randomized, quasi-experimental naturalistic arm of participants who have newly initiated a jail-to-community methadone treatment program (MTP, N=85) allows for comparisons to a methadone standard-of-care. RESULTS: We describe the rationale, design, and primary and secondary outcomes of the study. The primary outcome is an opioid relapse event; the primary contrast is a time-to-relapse comparison of XR-NTX and ETAU over a 24-week treatment phase. Secondary outcomes are rates of: (a) post-release opioid treatment participation, (b) opioid, alcohol, and cocaine use, (c) injection drug use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, (d) overdose (fatal and non-fatal) and all-cause mortality, and, (e) re-incarceration. CONCLUSIONS: XR-NTX is a potentially important, effective treatment and relapse prevention option for a large US population of persons with opioid use disorders leaving jails. This study will estimate XR-NTX's effectiveness relative to existing standards of care, including counseling-only treatment-as-usual and methadone maintenance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McDonald RD ; Tofighi B ; Laska E ; Goldfeld K ; Bonilla W ; Flannery M ; Santana-Correa N ; Johnson CW ; Leibowitz N ; Rotrosen J ; Gourevitch MN ; Lee JD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2016.05.002 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nCause of Death\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDrug Overdose/prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nMortality\r\nNaltrexone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nPatient Participation\r\n*Prisons\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nCriminal justice\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nJail\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpioid relapse prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McDonald RD, Tofighi B, Laska E, Goldfeld K, Bonilla W, Flannery M, Santana-Correa N, Johnson CW, Leibowitz N, Rotrosen J, Gourevitch MN, and Lee JD (2016) Extended-release naltrexone opioid treatment at jail reentry (XOR)..

Existing, evidence-based treatment options for opioid use disorder (OUD) are broadly underutilized, particularly by people experiencing homelessness (PEH). PEH are also more likely to misuse and overdose on opioids. To better understand current gaps and disparities in OUD treatment experienced by PEH and efforts to address them, we synthesized the literature reporting on the intersection of housing status and OUD treatment. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature from the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection. We included studies describing treatment-related outcomes specific to PEH and articles assessing OUD treatment interventions tailored to this population. Relevant findings were compiled via thematic analysis and narratively synthesized. RESULTS: 60 articles met our inclusion criteria, including 43 descriptive and 17 intervention-focused studies. These studies demonstrated that PEH experience more barriers to OUD treatment than their housed counterparts and access inpatient and detoxification treatment more commonly than pharmacotherapy. However, the reviewed literature indicated that PEH have similar outcomes once engaged in pharmacotherapy. Efficacious interventions for PEH were low-barrier and targeted, with housing interventions also demonstrating benefit. CONCLUSIONS: PEH have diminished access to evidence-based OUD treatment, particularly medications, and require targeted approaches to improve engagement and retention. To mitigate the disproportionate opioid-related morbidity and mortality PEH experience, innovative, flexible, and interdisciplinary OUD treatment models are necessary, with housing support playing an important role.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McLaughlin MF ; Li R ; Carrero ND ; Bain PA ; Chatterjee A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108717 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\n*Health Services Accessibility\r\n*Health Services Misuse\r\n*Ill-Housed Persons\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*epidemiology/*therapy\r\nUnited States/epidemiology\r\nHealthcare for the homeless\r\nHomelessness\r\nMOUD\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nSubstance use treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McLaughlin MF, Li R, Carrero ND, Bain PA, and Chatterjee A (2021) Opioid use disorder treatment for people experiencing homelessness: A scoping review..

We determined the impact of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) on treatment outcomes of opioid use disorder (OUD)-associated infectious diseases: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral suppression, hepatitis C virus (HCV) sustained virologic response, HCV reinfection, new hepatitis B virus infections, and infectious endocarditis-related outcomes. Manuscripts reporting on these infectious disease outcomes in adults with OUD receiving MOUD compared with those with OUD \"not\"receiving MOUD were included. Initial search yielded 8169 papers; 9 were included in the final review. The meta-analysis revealed that MOUD was associated with greater ART adherence (odds ratio [OR]=1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-2.15) and HIV viral suppression (OR=2.19; 95% CI=1.88-2.56). One study suggested a positive association between MOUD and HCV sustained virologic response. There is significant support for integrating MOUD with HIV treatment to improve viral suppression among persons with HIV (PWH) and OUD. Treatment of OUD among PWH should be a priority to combat the opioid and HIV epidemics.","Comments":"2021-11-16","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mcnamara K F; Biondi B E; Hernández-Ramírez R U; Taweh N ; Grimshaw A A; Springer S A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/ofid/ofab289","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ncocaine\r\nfentanyl\r\nicosapentaenoic acid\r\nmethamphetamine\r\nnaloxone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nribavirin\r\nsofosbuvir\r\nantiretroviral therapy\r\nbacterial endocarditis\r\nCD4 lymphocyte count\r\nClinical Global Impression scale\r\ncommunicable disease\r\nepidemic\r\nhealth care policy\r\nhepatitis B\r\nhepatitis C\r\nHepatitis C virus\r\nhospital readmission\r\nhospitalization\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nlimit of detection\r\nliver cirrhosis\r\nmedication compliance\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\nquestionnaire\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreinfection\r\nreview\r\nsexual transmission\r\nsustained virologic response\r\nsystematic review\r\nvirus load","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mcnamara K F, Biondi B E, Hernández-Ramírez R U, Taweh N, Grimshaw A A, and Springer S A (2021) A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies Evaluating the Effect of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder on Infectious Disease Outcomes.

Pharmacogenomics may explain this drug response variability and could allow for tailored therapy on an individual basis. The Food and Drug Administration and the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium have guidelines on pharmacogenomic testing for some opioids (e.g., codeine); however, no guidelines exist for the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine. Pharmacogenomic testing targets for buprenorphine include pharmacodynamic genes like the mu-opioid receptor (MOP receptor) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), as well as the pharmacokinetic genes like the CYP enzymes. In this review we identified genotypes in patients with opioid addiction receiving buprenorphine that may result in altered therapeutic dosing and increased rate of relapse. The OPRM1 A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs1799971) gene variant encoding the N40D MOP receptor has been associated with variable efficacy and response to treatment in both adult and neonatal patients receiving buprenorphine for treatment of opioid withdrawal. An SNP associated with rs678849 of OPRD1, coding for the delta opioid receptor, was associated with opioid relapse as indicated by opioid positive urine drug screens; there was also sex specific SNP identified at rs581111 and rs529520 in the European American population. COMT variability, particularly in rs4680, has been associated with length of stay and need for opioid treatment in patients with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Variations of the pharmacokinetic gene for CYP3A4 showed that the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype required higher doses of buprenorphine. Genotyping of patients may allow us to appropriately tailor buprenorphine therapy to individual patients and lead to improved patient outcomes; however, further research on the pharmacogenomics of buprenorphine is needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Meaden CW ; Mozeika A ; Asri R ; Santos CD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1038/s41397-020-00198-1 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nPharmacogenetics/methods\r\nPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics\r\nReceptors, Opioid, mu/genetics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Meaden CW, Mozeika A, Asri R, and Santos CD (2021) A review of the existing literature on buprenorphine pharmacogenomics..

DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (EMBED). SETTING: 18 emergency department clusters across five healthcare systems in five states representing the north east, south east, and western regions of the US, ranging from community hospitals to tertiary care centers, using either the Epic or Cerner electronic health record platform. PARTICIPANTS: 599 attending emergency physicians caring for 5047 adult patients presenting with opioid use disorder. INTERVENTION: A user centered, physician facing clinical decision support system seamlessly integrated into user workflows in the electronic health record to support initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department by helping clinicians to diagnose opioid use disorder, assess the severity of withdrawal, motivate patients to accept treatment, and complete electronic health record tasks by automating clinical and after visit documentation, order entry, prescribing, and referral. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of initiation of buprenorphine (administration or prescription of buprenorphine) in the emergency department among patients with opioid use disorder. Secondary implementation outcomes were measured with the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. RESULTS: 1 413 693 visits to the emergency department (775 873 in the intervention arm and 637 820 in the usual care arm) from November 2019 to May 2021 were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 5047 patients with opioid use disorder (2787 intervention arm, 2260 usual care arm) under the care of 599 attending physicians (340 intervention arm, 259 usual care arm) for analysis. Buprenorphine was initiated in 347 (12.5%) patients in the intervention arm and in 271 (12.0%) patients in the usual care arm (adjusted generalized estimating equations odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 2.43, P=0.58). Buprenorphine was initiated at least once by 151 (44.4%) physicians in the intervention arm and by 88 (34.0%) in the usual care arm (1.83, 1.16 to 2.89, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: User centered clinical decision support did not increase patient level rates of initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department. Although streamlining and automating electronic health record workflows can potentially increase adoption of complex, unfamiliar evidence based practices, more interventions are needed to look at other barriers to the treatment of addiction and increase the rate of initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department in patients with opioid use disorder.

Heroin addicts (previously unresponsive to treatment) made significant reductions in street heroin use at 6 months when treated with SIH. We now examine secondary outcomes. DESIGN: Multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing SIH versus OOM and SIM versus OOM. SETTING: Three supervised injectable opiate clinics in England. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic refractory heroin addicts continuing to inject street heroin virtually daily despite oral substitution treatment (n = 127), randomized to either SIH(n = 43), SIM(n = 42) or OOM(n = 42). All received high levels of medical and psychosocial support. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: wider drug use, crime, health and social functioning at 6 months. FINDINGS: At 6 months, no significant differences were found between treatment groups in wider drug use (crack/cocaine, benzodiazepines, alcohol), physical and mental health (SF-36) or social functioning. Within each treatment group, significant reductions were observed in crime [SIH = odds ratio (OR) 0.05; P < 0.001; SIM = OR 0.11; P = 0.002; OOM = OR 0.11; P = 0.003] and money spent per week on illicit drugs (SIH = mean change £-289.43; P < 0.001; SIM = mean change £-183.41; P < 0.001; OOM = mean change £-162.80; P < 0.001), with SIH significantly more likely to have reduced money spent on illicit drugs versus OOM (mean difference £-92.04; P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Supervised injectable heroin treatment and supervised injectable methadone treatment showed no clearly identified benefit over optimized oral methadone in terms of wider drug use, crime, physical and mental health within a 6-month period, despite reducing street heroin use to a greater extent.

To ensure methadone is taken as prescribed and to prevent diversion onto the illicit market, people starting methadone take their daily dose under a pharmacist’s supervision. Many patients miss their daily methadone dose risking withdrawal, craving for heroin and overdose due to loss of heroin tolerance. Contingency management (CM) can improve medication adherence, but remote delivery using technology may be resource-light and cost-effective. We developed an innovative way to deliver CM by mobile telephone. Software monitors patients’ attendance and supervised methadone consumption through an internet self-login at the pharmacy and sends reinforcing text messages to patients’ mobile telephones. A linked system sends medication adherence reports to prescribers and provides early warning alerts of missed doses. A pre-paid debit card system provides financial incentives. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial design was used to test the feasibility of conducting a future trial of mobile telephone CM to encourage adherence to supervised methadone in community pharmacies. Each cluster (drug service/3 allied pharmacies) was randomly allocated to provide patient’s presenting for a new episode of opiate agonist treatment (OAT) with either (a) mobile telephone text message CM, (b) mobile telephone text message reminders, or (c) no text messages. We assessed acceptability of the interventions, recruitment, and follow-up procedures. Results: Four drug clinics were approached and three recruited. Thirty-three pharmacists were approached and 9 recruited. Over 3 months, 173 individuals were screened and 10 enrolled. Few patients presented for OAT and high numbers were excluded due to receiving buprenorphine or not attending participating pharmacies. There was 96% consistency in recording medication adherence by self-login vs. pharmacy records. In focus groups, CM participants were positive about using self-login, the text messages, and debit card. Prescribers found weekly reporting, time saving, and allowed closer monitoring of patients. Pharmacists reported that the tablet device was easy to host. Conclusion: Mobile telephone CM worked well, but a planned future trial will use modified eligibility criteria (existing OAT patients who regularly miss their methadone/buprenorphine doses) and increase the number of participating pharmacies. Trial registration: The trial is retrospectively registered, ISRCTN 58958179.","Comments":"2021-03-05","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Metrebian N ; Carr E ; Goldsmith K ; Weaver T ; Pilling S ; Shearer J ; Woolston-Thomas K ; Tas B ; Cooper C ; Getty C A; van der Waal R ; Kelleher M ; Finch E ; Bijral P ; Taylor D ; Scott J ; Strang J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s40814-020-00761-4","Keywords":"mobile phone\r\ntablet computer\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncost effectiveness analysis\r\ndrug use\r\nfeasibility study\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmedication compliance\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\npharmacist\r\npharmacy (shop)\r\nrandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Metrebian N, Carr E, Goldsmith K, Weaver T, Pilling S, Shearer J, Woolston-Thomas K, Tas B, Cooper C, Getty C A, van der Waal R, Kelleher M, Finch E, Bijral P, Taylor D, Scott J, and Strang J (2021) Mobile telephone delivered contingency management for encouraging adherence to supervised methadone consumption: feasibility study for an RCT of clinical and cost-effectiveness (TIES).

Many newborns exposed to methadone in utero experience neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS); however NAS severity is unpredictable. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the relationship between maternal and neonatal methadone exposure and the severity of NAS. METHODS: An IRB-approved study was conducted in pregnant women on methadone maintenance therapy. Plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected from women during labor. DBS were collected from umiblical cord blood and infant at newborn screen. R-and S-methadone, R-and S-EDDP were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Associations between methadone exposure and total and maximum neonatal morphine dose and neonatal length of stay (LOS) were examined. RESULTS: Twenty women (23-42 years) and infants (EGA 3662412) completed the study. Median maternal methadone dose at delivery was 112 mg/d (range 60-180 mg/d). 16 neonates experienced NAS requiring morphine; 4 also required phe-nobarbital. Median total morphine dose was 5.6 mg/kg (3.4-17.5 mg/kg), maximum dose was 0.05 mg/kg/d (0.02-0.61 mg/kg/d), and LOS was 26 days (5-55 days). Total morphine dose was not associated with maternal or fetal exposure to methadone. Maximum daily morphine dose was associated with higher maternal exposure to Rand S-methadone and S-EDDP (p <0.005). Higher cord blood concentrations of Rand S-EDDP were associated with higher maximum doses of morphine (p<0.05). LOS was negatively correlated with maternal R-and S-EDDP exposure and cord blood S-EDDP (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: While additional studies are needed, maternal methadone AUC and cord blood concentration at delivery may be potential markers for NAS severity.","Comments":"2017-01-26","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Metzger I F; Schwartz A E; Haneline L S; Haas D M; Evrard C A; Yeley B C; Jones D R; Masters A R; Renbarger J L; Quinney S K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/cpt.570","Keywords":"methadone\r\nmorphine\r\nadverse drug reaction\r\nblood level\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical trial\r\ndrug megadose\r\nfemale\r\nfetus\r\nhuman\r\nhuman tissue\r\ninfant\r\nlength of stay\r\nliquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\r\nmaternal exposure\r\nmaximum permissible dose\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nnewborn\r\npilot study\r\npregnant woman\r\nside effect\r\numbilical cord blood","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Metzger I F, Schwartz A E, Haneline L S, Haas D M, Evrard C A, Yeley B C, Jones D R, Masters A R, Renbarger J L, and Quinney S K (2017) Maternal and fetal methadone exposure: Associations with neonatal abstinence syndrome.

From a pharmacological perspective, naltrexone works. From an applied perspective, however, the medication compliance and the retention rates are very poor. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library issue 6 2010), PubMed (1973- June 2010), CINAHL (1982- June 2010). We inspected reference lists of relevant articles and we contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors and other Cochrane review groups. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised and controlled clinical trials which focus on the use of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo, or other treatments to reach sustained abstinence from opiate drugs DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. One reviewer carried out the qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies using validated checklists. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies, 1158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review.Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatments, no statistically significant difference were noted for all the primary outcomes considered. The only outcome statistically significant in favour of naltrexone is re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84), but results come only from two studies.Comparing naltrexone versus psychotherapy, in the two considered outcomes, no statistically significant difference was found in the single study considered.Naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines and to buprenorphine for retention and abstinence and side effects. Results come from single studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Minozzi S ; Amato L ; Vecchi S ; Davoli M ; Kirchmayer U ; Verster A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD001333.pub3 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nControlled Clinical Trials as Topic\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Minozzi S, Amato L, Vecchi S, Davoli M, Kirchmayer U, and Verster A (2011) Oral naltrexone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence..

Nevertheless, no studies have been published that systematically assess the effectiveness of the pharmacological detoxification among adolescents. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of any detoxification treatment alone or in combination with psychosocial intervention compared with no intervention, other pharmacological intervention or psychosocial interventions on completion of treatment, reducing the use of substances and improving health and social status. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 1), PubMed (January 1966 to January 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2014), CINHAL (January 1982 to January 2014), Web of Science (1991-January 2014) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing any pharmacological interventions alone or associated with psychosocial intervention aimed at detoxification with no intervention, placebo, other pharmacological intervention or psychosocial intervention in adolescents (13 to 18 years). Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration Main results: Two trials involving 190 participants were included. One trial compared buprenorphine with clonidine for detoxification. No difference was found for drop out: risk ratio (RR) 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20 to 1.04) and acceptability of treatment: withdrawal score mean difference (MD): 3.97 (95% CI -1.38 to 9.32). More participants in the buprenorphine group initiated naltrexone treatment: RR 11.00 (95% CI 1.58 to 76.55), quality of evidence moderate. The other trial compared maintenance treatment versus detoxification treatment: buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance versus buprenorphine detoxification. For drop out the results were in favour of maintenance treatment: RR 2.67 (95% CI 1.85, 3.86), as well as for results at follow-up RR 1.36 [95% CI 1.05to 1.76); no differences for use of opiate, quality of evidence low. Authors' conclusions: It is difficult to draw conclusions on the basis of two trials with few participants. Furthermore, the two studies included did not consider the efficacy of methadone that is still the most frequent drug utilised for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. One possible reason for the lack of evidence could be the difficulty in conducting trials with young people due to practical and ethical reasons.","Comments":"2018-02-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Minozzi S ; Amato L ; Bellisario C ; Davoli M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD006749.pub3","Keywords":"alcohol\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ncannabis\r\nclonidine\r\ncocaine\r\nopiate\r\nadolescent\r\nalcoholism\r\ncannabis addiction\r\ncocaine dependence\r\ndrug detoxification\r\nfollow up\r\nheadache\r\nhealth status\r\nhuman\r\nmeta analysis\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\npriority journal\r\npsychosocial care\r\nreview\r\nself report\r\nsocial status\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Minozzi S, Amato L, Bellisario C, and Davoli M (2014) Detoxification treatments for opiate dependent adolescents.

Just in the United States alone, among pregnant women with hospital delivery, a fourfold increase in opioid use is reported from 1999 to 2014 (Haight 2018). Heroin crosses the placenta, and pregnant, opiate-dependent women experience a six-fold increase in maternal obstetric complications such as low birth weight, toxaemia, third trimester bleeding, malpresentation, puerperal morbidity, fetal distress and meconium aspiration. Neonatal complications include narcotic withdrawal, postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, neuro-behavioural problems, increased neonatal mortality and a 74-fold increase in sudden infant death syndrome. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review first published in 2008 and last updated in 2013. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of any maintenance treatment alone or in combination with a psychosocial intervention compared to no intervention, other pharmacological intervention or psychosocial interventions alone for child health status, neonatal mortality, retaining pregnant women in treatment, and reducing the use of substances. Search methods: We updated our searches of the following databases to February 2020: the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science. We also searched two trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials which assessed the efficacy of any pharmacological maintenance treatment for opiate-dependent pregnant women. Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: We found four trials with 271 pregnant women. Three compared methadone with buprenorphine and one methadone with oral slow-release morphine. Three out of four studies had adequate allocation concealment and were double-blind. The major flaw in the included studies was attrition bias: three out of four had a high dropout rate (30% to 40%), and this was unbalanced between groups. Methadone versus buprenorphine:. There was probably no evidence of a difference in the dropout rate from treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37 to 1.20, three studies, 223 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference in the use of primary substances between methadone and buprenorphine (RR 1.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.68, two studies, 151 participants, low-quality evidence). Birth weight may be higher in the buprenorphine group in the two trials that reported data MD;-530.00 g, 95%CI -662.78 to -397.22 (one study, 19 particpants) and MD: -215.00 g, 95%CI -238.93 to -191.07 (one study, 131 participants) although the results could not be pooled due to very high heterogeneity (very low-quality of evidence). The third study reported that there was no evidence of a difference. We found there may be no evidence of a difference in the APGAR score (MD: 0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.03, two studies,163 participants, low-quality evidence). Many measures were used in the studies to assess neonatal abstinence syndrome. The number of newborns treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is the most critical outcome, may not differ between groups (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to1.63, three studies, 166 participants, low-quality evidence). Only one study which compared methadone with buprenorphine reported side effects. We found there may be no evidence of a difference in the number of mothers with serious adverse events (AEs) (RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.75 to 3.83, 175 participants, low-quality evidence) and we found there may be no difference in the numbers of newborns with serious AEs (RR 4.77, 95% CI 0.59, 38.49,131 participants, low-quality evidence). Methadone versus slow-release morphine:. There were no dropouts in either treatment group. Oral slow-release morphine may be superior to methadone for abstinence from heroin use during pregnancy (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.77, one study, 48 participants, low-quality evidence). In the comparison between methadone and slow-release morphine, no side effects were reported for the mother. In contrast, one child in the methadone group had central apnoea, and one child in the morphine group had obstructive apnoea (low-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: Methadone and buprenorphine may be similar in efficacy and safety for the treatment of opioid-dependent pregnant women and their babies. There is not enough evidence to make conclusions for the comparison between methadone and slow-release morphine. Overall, the body of evidence is too small to make firm conclusions about the equivalence of the treatments compared. There is still a need for randomised controlled trials of adequate sample size comparing different maintenance treatments.","Comments":"2021-05-11","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Minozzi S ; Amato L ; Jahanfar S ; Bellisario C ; Ferri M ; Davoli M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD006318.pub4","Keywords":"NCT03098407\r\nbuprenorphine\r\ncodeine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nlevacetylmethadol\r\nmethadone\r\nmorphine\r\nnicotine\r\nApgar score\r\nbirth weight\r\nbleeding\r\nbreast feeding\r\nbreathing rate\r\ncentral sleep apnea syndrome\r\ncesarean section\r\nchild health\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\ncombination chemotherapy\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug release\r\ndrug safety\r\nDSM-IV\r\nevidence based practice\r\nfetus distress\r\nfollow up\r\ngrimace\r\nhealth status\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmalpresentation\r\nmeconium aspiration\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmonotherapy\r\nmorbidity\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nnewborn mortality\r\nopiate addiction\r\nphysical activity\r\nphysical appearance\r\npregnant woman\r\npremature labor\r\npriority journal\r\npsychosocial intervention\r\npuerperal morbidity\r\npulse rate\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nrisk factor\r\nsensitivity analysis\r\nsleep apnea syndromes\r\nsystematic review\r\nthird trimester pregnancy\r\ntreatment duration\r\ntreatment outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Minozzi S, Amato L, Jahanfar S, Bellisario C, Ferri M, and Davoli M (2020) Maintenance agonist treatments for opiate-dependent pregnant women.

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of OP and IOP level counseling when provided as part of buprenorphine treatment for opioid-dependent African Americans. METHODS: Participants were African American men and women starting buprenorphine treatment at one of two community-based clinics (N=300). Participants were randomly assigned to OP or IOP. Measures at baseline, 3- and 6-month included the primary outcome of DSM-IV opioid and cocaine dependence criteria, as well as additional outcomes of illicit opioid and cocaine use (urine test and self-report), criminal activity, retention in treatment, Quality of Life, Addiction Severity Index composite scores, and HIV risk behaviors. RESULTS: Participants assigned to OP received, on average, 3.67 (SD=1.30)h of counseling per active week in treatment. IOP participants received an average of 5.23 (SD=1.68)h of counseling per active week (less than the anticipated 9h per week of counseling). Both groups showed substantial improvement over a 6-month period on nearly all measures considered. There were no significant differences between groups in meeting diagnostic criteria for opioid (p=.67) or cocaine dependence (p=.63). There were no significant between group differences on any of the other outcomes. A secondary analysis restricting the sample to participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for baseline cocaine dependence also revealed no significant between-group differences (all ps>.05).

METHODS: This two-group randomized controlled trial recruited 288 youth, ages 15-21, with moderate/severe OUD from a residential addiction treatment program in Baltimore, Maryland. The study randomized the youth within the first week of treatment entry to receive either XR-NTX or treatment-as-usual (TAU; either buprenorphine maintenance treatment or treatment without OUD medication following medically managed withdrawal) prior to discharge, with continued treatment in the community for 6 months. However, due to various reasons spanning patients' and caregivers' preferences and constraints, considerable participant nonadherence to randomized condition occurred (i.e., only 30% of the participants randomized to XR-NTX received an initial injection, while 27% of participants randomized to TAU received an XR-NTX injection at treatment discharge, instead of their assigned treatment). The study used generalized linear mixed modeling (GLiMM) to examine self-reported 90-day opioid, cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol use as well as DSM-5 OUD criteria on \"intention-to-treat\" (as randomized), \"as-received\" (XR-NTX vs. not XR-NTX), and \"as-medicated\" (XR-NTX vs. buprenorphine vs. no medication) bases. RESULTS: The condition x time interactions in the intention-to-treat analyses failed to reach significance for past-90-day self-reported use of illicit opioids, cocaine, marijuana, or alcohol, or in meeting DSM-5 OUD criteria at 3 or 6 months [all ps > 0.05]. However, these findings are of limited interpretive value due to participant nonadherence to their randomized condition. When the study analyzed results by the treatment received at discharge, the \"as-received\" group x time interaction for illicit opioid use was significant [p = .003], with the XR-NTX group reporting less opioid use in the past 90 days at 3 and 6 months. Participants who received their first XR-NTX dose at inpatient discharge (n = 82) received, on average, 1.3 subsequent injections in the community over the 6-month study follow-up period. Only 2 of the 82 study participants received XR-NTX continuously through the 6-month postdischarge follow-up period. Twelve serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred during the study, but the study determined that only 1 was possibly study related (hepatitis C/elevated liver function test results). CONCLUSION: None of the condition x time interactions in the intention-to-treat analyses reached significance. Participants' nonadherence may have contributed to the failure to reject the null hypothesis. Irrespective of randomized condition, participants who received XR-NTX for OUD demonstrated low retention in treatment, receiving an average of only 1.3 subsequent injections, yet reported less opioid use at follow-up than participants who did not received XR-NTX. Treatment programs should consider XR-NTX as a treatment option for youth motivated to receive it. Future research should focus on building developmentally informed strategies to improve uptake of and adherence to relapse prevention medication in this population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mitchell SG ; Monico LB ; Gryczynski J ; Fishman MJ ; O'Grady KE ; Schwartz RP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108407 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAftercare\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\n*Naltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPatient Discharge\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAdolescent\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nTreatment\r\nYoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mitchell SG, Monico LB, Gryczynski J, Fishman MJ, O'Grady KE, and Schwartz RP (2021) Extended-release naltrexone for youth with opioid use disorder..

This study evaluated the impact of initial randomized OAT allocation on subsequent switching among people with prescription-type opioid use disorder (POUD). METHODS: Secondary analysis of a 24-week Canadian multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial conducted between 2017 and 2020 comparing flexible take-home buprenorphine/naloxone versus supervised methadone models of care for POUD. We used Cox Proportional Hazards modeling to assess for impact of treatment assignment on time to OAT switching, adjusting for important confounders. For clinical correlates, we analyzed data from baseline questionnaires on demographic, substance use, and health factors as well as urine drug screen. RESULTS: Of 272 randomized participants, 210 initiated OAT within 14 days per trial protocol, of whom 103 participants were randomized to buprenorphine/naloxone and 107 to methadone. Within 24-week follow-up, 41 (20.5%) of all participants switched OAT with 25 (24.3%, median 27 days, 88.4 per 100 person-years) and 16 participants (15.0%, median 53.5 days, 46.1 per 100 person-years) switching from buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone arms, respectively. In adjusted analysis, allocation to buprenorphine/naloxone was associated with significantly higher risk of switching (aHR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.22 - 4.38). CONCLUSIONS: OAT switching was common in this sample of individuals with POUD, with individuals randomly allocated to buprenorphine/naloxone being more than twice as likely to switch versus methadone. This may reflect a stepped care approach in OUD management. More research is needed to evaluate overall retention and outcomes with the different observed risks of switching between methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mocanu V ; Bozinoff N ; Wood E ; Jutras-Aswad D ; Le Foll B ; Lim R ; Cheol Choi J; Yin Mok W; Eugenia Socias M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.109932 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nCanada\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/complications\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nPrescriptions\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid agonist therapy\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nPrescription opioids\r\nRotation\r\nSwitching","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mocanu V, Bozinoff N, Wood E, Jutras-Aswad D, Le Foll B, Lim R, Cheol Choi J, Yin Mok W, and Eugenia Socias M (2023) Opioid agonist therapy switching among individuals with prescription-type opioid use disorder: Secondary analysis of a pragmatic randomized trial..

Standard regimens require that patients be in opioid withdrawal prior to induction, which is a barrier for many. Micro-induction is a novel induction approach that does not require patients to be in withdrawal. Our primary objective is to synthesize available evidence on the effectiveness of micro-inductions on patient and clinical outcomes compared to standard dosing or other approaches, or evaluated without a comparator group. Secondary objectives are to synthesize evidence on clinical factors that influence micro-induction effectiveness, and to summarize micro-induction regimens described in the literature. Methods: We will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Psycinfo, Science Citation Index, and the grey literature for studies that include adolescents or adults with opioid use disorder who received a buprenorphine micro-induction regimen. We will consider any patient or clinical outcomes defined by study authors. We will include controlled and non-controlled interventional studies, observational studies, case reports/series and reports from relevant organizations or guidelines pertinent to our third objective. We will select studies, extract data and assess study quality (using the Downs and Black, and Cochrane Risk of Bias tools) in duplicate. We will narratively synthesize our results, and will meta-analyze outcome measures if multiple studies report common outcomes with acceptably low heterogeneity. Discussion: Our review will include the most up-to-date available data on buprenorphine micro-inductions. We anticipate limitations relating to study heterogeneity and quality. We will disseminate study results widely to inform updated guidelines for opioid agonist therapy prescribers.","Comments":"2020-08-19","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moe J ; Doyle-Waters M M; O'Sullivan F ; Hohl C M; Azar P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106551","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nadverse outcome\r\narticle\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\nclinical outcome\r\nclinical protocol\r\ndrug delivery system\r\ndrug dose regimen\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug retention\r\ndrug safety\r\nhuman\r\nmedication compliance\r\nmicro induction\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient comfort\r\npractice guideline\r\nprescription\r\nsocial status\r\nsystematic review\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moe J, Doyle-Waters M M, O'Sullivan F, Hohl C M, and Azar P (2020) Effectiveness of micro-induction approaches to buprenorphine initiation: A systematic review protocol.

Current pharmacotherapies have limited efficacy and cause serious side effects. Increasing bodies of evidences suggest the neuropeptide, oxytocin (OT), as a potential treatment for drug abuse disorders. The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of OT on withdrawal, craving and anxiety scores, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) blood level in heroin-dependent male patients. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 58 males with opioid dependence by Abstinence Center of Addictive People in Iran. The participants were randomly allocated to receive intranasal OT (single dose; 40 IU, n = 29) or placebo (n = 29). Heroine withdrawal, craving and anxiety scores were measured using the Opioid Withdrawal Scale, Visual Analogue Scale and (Desire for Drug Questionnaire), and Hamilton checklist respectively. The cortisol and DHEAS levels at baseline and different post-intervention time were measured using a competitive immunoanalysis method. Acute OT administration reduced craving and withdrawal scores but did not change anxiety significantly. Single dose of OT decreased the level of cortisol and improved the cortisol/DHEAS ratio in the heroin users during abstinence (p < 0.01). These results suggest that OT may be useful in the attenuation of craving, withdrawal symptom in heroin-dependent patients and might be considered a new potential treatment for heroin dependence where positive effects of OT on stress-related hormones may be involved in this effect of OT.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moeini M ; Omidi A ; Sehat M ; Banafshe HR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000496194 ","Keywords":"Administration, Intranasal\r\nAdult\r\nAnxiety/complications/drug therapy\r\nCraving/*drug effects\r\nDehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/blood\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHeroin Dependence/blood/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nHydrocortisone/blood\r\nMale\r\nOxytocin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use\r\nStress, Psychological/complications/*drug therapy\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/complications/*drug therapy\r\nYoung Adult\r\nCortisol\r\nCraving\r\nHeroin\r\nOxytocin\r\nWithdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moeini M, Omidi A, Sehat M, and Banafshe HR (2019) The Effects of Oxytocin on Withdrawal, Craving and Stress Response in Heroin-Dependent Patients: A Randomized, Double-Blind Clinical Trial..

In ASEAN countries, methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) has been implemented for over a decade to replace forced detoxification programs.

Aims: We aimed to summarize the current evidence on the effectiveness of MMT in preventing relapses in drug addicts living in ASEAN countries. Methodology: A search through the literature for original research articles written in English and published between 1990 and 2016 was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Articles were screened and extracted by two independent reviewers. Results: The results showed that MMT alone or incorporation into other programs was effective in reducing concurrent illicit drug use and withdrawal from treatment across ASEAN countries. Higher methadone doses were reported to have better retention effects than those due to lower doses. Conclusion: In summary, MMT is effective in preventing relapses into addiction behaviour from occurring in patients in ASEAN countries. Health professions should adjust the methadone dosage to suit the individual requirements of patients and ensure compliance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mohd Fahami ; N A ; Shuid A N; Abdullah A ; Naina-Mohamed I ; Chin K Y; Mohamed N ; Masbah N ; Mohd Saad ; Q H ; Kamisah Y ; Muhammad N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"adult\r\ndrug megadose\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfemale\r\nharm reduction\r\nhuman\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmale\r\nMedline\r\nmethadone treatment\r\noccupation\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprevention\r\nrelapse\r\nreview\r\nScopus\r\nsubstance abuse\r\nsystematic review\r\nWeb of Science\r\nillicit drug\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mohd Fahami, N A, Shuid A N, Abdullah A, Naina-Mohamed I, Chin K Y, Mohamed N, Masbah N, Mohd Saad, Q H, Kamisah Y, and Muhammad N (2019) A systematic review of methadone maintenance therapy studies in preventing relapses in addiction: Evidence from asean countries.

Research suggests that opioid use significantly increases smoking, which could account for the strikingly low smoking-cessation rates observed in both methadone- and buprenorphine-maintained patients, even with the use of first-line smoking-cessation interventions. If opioids present a barrier to smoking-cessation, then better smoking outcomes should be observed in OUD patients treated with extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, an opioid antagonist) compared to those receiving buprenorphine (BUP-NX, a partial opioid agonist). METHODS: The current study is a secondary analysis of a 24-week, multi-site, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network comparing the effectiveness of XR-NTX vs. BUP-NX for adults with OUD. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used to determine if there was a significant reduction in cigarette use among daily smokers successfully inducted to treatment (n = 373) and a subset of those who completed treatment (n = 169). RESULTS: Among daily smokers inducted onto OUD medication, those in the XR-NTX group smoked fewer cigarettes per day (M = 11.36, SE = 0.62) relative to smokers in the BUP-NX group (M = 13.33, SE = 0.58) across all study visits, (b (SE) = -1.97 (0.55), p < .01).

CONCLUSIONS: OUD patients treated with XR-NTX reduced cigarette use more than those treated with BUP-NX, suggesting that XR-NTX in combination with other smoking cessation interventions might be a better choice for OUD smokers interested in reducing their tobacco use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Montgomery L ; Winhusen T ; Scodes J ; Pavlicova M ; Twitty D ; Campbell ANC ; Wang AL ; Nunes EV ; Rotrosen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108489 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nTobacco Use\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nCigarettes\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nSmoking","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Montgomery L, Winhusen T, Scodes J, Pavlicova M, Twitty D, Campbell ANC, Wang AL, Nunes EV, and Rotrosen J (2021) Reductions in tobacco use in naltrexone, relative to buprenorphine-maintained individuals with opioid use disorder: Secondary analysis from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network..

There were a sufficient number of methadone RCTs to meta-analyze; there were too few buprenorphine or naltrexone studies. All quasi-experimental studies were systematically reviewed. Data from RCTs involving 807 inmates (treatment n = 407, control n = 400) showed that methadone provided during incarceration increased community treatment engagement (n = 3 studies; OR = 8.69, 95% CI = 2.46; 30.75), reduced illicit opioid use (n = 4 studies; OR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.15; 0.32) and injection drug use (n = 3 studies; OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.12; 0.56), but did not reduce recidivism (n = 4 studies; OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.51; 1.68). Data from observational studies of methadone showed consistent findings. Individual review of buprenorphine and naltrexone studies showed these medications were either superior to methadone or to placebo, or were as effective as methadone in reducing illicit opioid use post-release. Results provide the first meta-analytic summary of MATs delivered in correctional settings and support the use of MATs, especially with regard to community substance use treatment engagement and opioid use; additional work is needed to understand the reduction of recidivism and other health risk behaviors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moore KE ; Roberts W ; Reid HH ; Smith KMZ ; Oberleitner LMS ; McKee SA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2018.12.003 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage\r\nNaltrexone/administration & dosage\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\n*Prisons\r\n*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nRecidivism/statistics & numerical data\r\nRisk-Taking\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nIncarceration\r\nMedication assisted treatment\r\nMethadone\r\nNaltrexone","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moore KE, Roberts W, Reid HH, Smith KMZ, Oberleitner LMS, and McKee SA (2019) Effectiveness of medication assisted treatment for opioid use in prison and jail settings: A meta-analysis and systematic review..

Though effective, multiple barriers to face-to-face counseling exist. The Recovery Line (RL), an automated, self-management system based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is a phone-based adjunctive treatment that provides low cost, consistent delivery and immediate therapeutic availability 24 h a day. METHODS: The current study was a 12-week randomized clinical efficacy trial of treatment-as-usual (TAU) only or RL + TAU for methadone treatment patients with continued illicit drug use (N = 82). Previous small trial phases evaluated methods to increase participant engagement and use of the RL and were incorporated into the current RL version. Primary outcomes were days of self-reported illicit drug abstinence and urine screens negative for illicit drugs. RESULTS: Days of self-reported illicit drug abstinence improved for patients in RL + TAU but not in TAU. Percent of urine screens negative for illicit drugs, coping skills efficacy, and retention in methadone treatment did not differ by condition. Patients in RL + TAU attended more substance use disorder treatment and self-help group sessions during treatment than those in TAU. RL system use was generally low and more system use was correlated with abstinence outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the RL did not impact urine screen outcomes, it increases self-reported abstinence. Additional methods to increase patient engagement with automated, self-management systems for substance use disorder are needed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Moore BA ; Buono FD ; Lloyd DP ; Printz DMB ; Fiellin DA ; Barry DT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2018.11.011 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nIllicit Drugs\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care\r\nSelf Report\r\n*Self-Help Groups\r\n*Self-Management\r\n*Substance Abuse Detection\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nTelephone\r\nComputer-based treatment\r\nIVR\r\nMethadone treatment\r\nOpioid-related disorders","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Moore BA, Buono FD, Lloyd DP, Printz DMB, Fiellin DA, and Barry DT (2019) A randomized clinical trial of the Recovery Line among methadone treatment patients with ongoing illicit drug use..

Effective interventions for opioid use disorders are available; however, given the scarce resources faced by substance use treatment providers and payers of all kinds, evidence of effectiveness is not always sufficient to encourage adoption of a given therapy-nor should it be. Economic evaluations can provide evidence that will help stakeholders efficiently allocate their resources. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the literature on economic evaluations of opioid use disorder interventions. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the major electronic databases from inception until August 2015. A sensitive approach was used to ensure a comprehensive list of relevant articles. Given the quality of the existing reviews, we narrowed our search to studies published since 2007. The Drummond checklist was used to evaluate and categorize economic evaluation studies according to their quality. RESULTS: A total of 98 articles were identified as potentially relevant to the current study. Of these 98 articles, half (n = 49) were included in this study. Six of the included articles were reviews. The remaining 43 articles reported economic evaluation studies of interventions for opioid use disorders. In general, the evidence on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) supports previous findings that MMT is an economically advantageous opioid use disorder therapy. The economic literature comparing MMT with other opioid use disorder pharmacotherapies is limited, as is the literature on other forms of therapy. CONCLUSION: With the possible exception of MMT, additional high-quality economic evaluations are needed in order to assess the relative value of existing opioid use disorder interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murphy SM ; Polsky D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40273-016-0400-5 ","Keywords":"Cost-Benefit Analysis\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage/economics\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/economics/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/economics/*rehabilitation\r\nResearch Design","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murphy SM, and Polsky D (2016) Economic Evaluations of Opioid Use Disorder Interventions..

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a previously reported randomized clinical trial of 570 adults in 8 U.S. inpatient or residential treatment programs. DATA SOURCES: Study instruments. TARGET POPULATION: Adults with opioid use disorder. TIME HORIZON: 24-week intervention with an additional 12 weeks of observation. PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector and societal. INTERVENTIONS: Buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release naltrexone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs combined with incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental time abstinent from opioids. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Use of the health care sector perspective and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY showed buprenorphine-naloxone to be preferable to extended-release naltrexone in 97% of bootstrap replications at 24 weeks and in 85% at 36 weeks. Similar results were obtained with incremental time abstinent from opioids as an outcome and with use of the societal perspective. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The base-case results were sensitive to the cost of the 2 treatments and the success of randomized treatment initiation. LIMITATION: Relatively short follow-up for a chronic condition, substantial missing data, no information on patient out-of-pocket and social service costs. CONCLUSION: Buprenorphine-naloxone is preferred to extended-release naltrexone as first-line treatment when both options are clinically appropriate and patients require detoxification before initiating extended-release naltrexone.

DESIGN: This was a retrospective secondary analysis of CTN-0051 trial data, including follow-up data over 24-36 weeks. SETTING: Eight community-based, inpatient-detoxification and follow-up outpatient treatment facilities in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 283 participants randomized to receive XR-NTX. MEASUREMENTS: Efficiency was estimated using a multivariable generalized structural equation model to explore simultaneous determinants of XR-NTX induction and induction duration (detoxification + residential days). Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the health-care sector perspective and included expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). FINDINGS: Treatment site was the only modifiable factor that simultaneously increased the likelihood of XR-NTX induction and decreased induction duration. Incorporating the higher predicted probability of XR-NTX induction, and fewer predicted days of detoxification and subsequent residential treatment into the cost-effectiveness framework, reduced the incremental average 24-week total cost of XR-NTX treatment from $5317 more than that of BUP-NX (P = 0.01) to a non-statistically-significant difference of $1016 (P = 0.63). QALYs gained remained similar across arms. CONCLUSION: Adopting an efficient model of extended-release naltrexone initiation could result in extended-release naltrexone and buprenorphine-naloxone being of comparable economic value from the health-care sector perspective over 24-36 weeks for patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder at an inpatient detoxification facility.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murphy SM ; Jeng PJ ; McCollister KE ; Leff JA ; Jalali A ; Shulman M ; Lee JD ; Nunes EV ; Novo P ; Rotrosen J ; Schackman BR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.15531 ","Keywords":"Cost-Benefit Analysis\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\n*Naltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nUnited States\r\nBuprenorphine-naloxone\r\ncost-effectiveness\r\nefficiency\r\nextended-release naltrexone\r\ninduction\r\nopioid detoxification\r\nopioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murphy SM, Jeng PJ, McCollister KE, Leff JA, Jalali A, Shulman M, Lee JD, Nunes EV, Novo P, Rotrosen J, and Schackman BR (2021) Cost-effectiveness implications of increasing the efficiency of the extended-release naltrexone induction process for the treatment of opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis..

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with random assignment to 12 weeks of varenicline 1 mg twice daily (n = 57) or matched placebo (n = 55), with in-person and telephone counseling. SETTING: Urban methadone programs in the Bronx, New York City, New York, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Methadone maintenance patients, smoking ≥5 cigarettes/day, interested in quitting, stable in methadone treatment, without current Axis I psychiatric disorders, suicidal ideation or recent suicide attempts. MEASUREMENTS: Seven-day point prevalence abstinence verified by expired carbon monoxide (CO) < 8 parts per million at week 12 (primary outcome); carbon monoxide (CO)-verified abstinence, cigarettes/day, incident Axis I psychiatric illness, suicidal ideation or serious adverse events (SAEs) at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 or 24 (secondary outcomes). FINDINGS: Baseline demographic, smoking and clinical factors were similar between groups. Retention at 24 weeks was 90%. Subjects receiving varenicline were more likely than those receiving placebo to achieve abstinence (10.5 versus 0%, P = 0.03; effect size 10.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.4-19.3%) and to reduce smoking (median five versus two cigarettes/day, P < 0.001) at 12 weeks. These effects were not maintained after drug treatment ceased. Incident psychiatric illness (OR= 0.84, 95% CI = 0.16, 4.4) and suicidality [odds ratio (OR) = 0.88, 95% CI 0.2, 3.9] were not different between groups. There were no psychiatric or cardiac SAEs.

This study aimed to compare fentanyl and methadone in this regard. Methods: This prospective, single-blinded, controlled pilot study was conducted on opioid-dependent intubated patients admitted to the toxicology ICU of Loghman Hakim Hospital, Tehran, Iran, between August 2019 and August 2020. Patients were alternately assigned to either fentanyl or methadone group after the initiation of their withdrawal syndrome. Duration and alleviation of the withdrawal signs and symptoms, ICU and hospital stay, development of complications, development of later signs/symptoms of withdrawal syndrome, and need for further administration of sedatives to treat agitation were then compared between these two groups. Results: Median age of the patients was 42 [interquartile range (IQR): 26, 56]. The two groups were similar in terms of the patients' age (p = 0.92), sex (p = 0.632), primary Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II (p = 0.861), and Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Score (COWS) before (p = 0.537) and 120 minutes after treatment (p = 0.136) with either methadone or fentanyl. The duration ofintubation (p = 0.120), and ICU stay (p = 0.572), were also similar between the two groups. The only factor that was significantly different between the two groups was the time needed for alleviation of the withdrawal signs and symptoms after the administration of the medication, which was significantly shorter in the methadone group (30 vs. 120 minutes, p = 0.007). Conclusion: It seems that methadone treats the withdrawal signs and symptoms faster in dependent patients. However, these drugs are similarly powerful in controlling the withdrawal signs in these patients.","Comments":"2022-01-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Najafi B ; Shadnia S ; Hassanian-Moghaddam H ; Heydarian A ; Mahdavinejad A ; Zamani N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.22037/aaem.v9i1.1384","Keywords":"IRCT20150110020624N2\r\nclonidine\r\nfentanyl\r\nmethadone\r\nsedative agent\r\nacute kidney tubule necrosis\r\nadolescent\r\nadult\r\nadult respiratory distress syndrome\r\naged\r\nagitation\r\narticle\r\naspiration pneumonia\r\nclinical article\r\nClinical Opiate Withdrawal Score\r\ncontrolled clinical trial\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndecubitus\r\ndrug dose increase\r\ndrug dose reduction\r\ndrug therapy\r\nhuman\r\nintensive care unit\r\nintubation\r\nlength of stay\r\nmiddle aged\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain\r\npatient care\r\npilot study\r\nprospective study\r\nrhabdomyolysis\r\nscoring system\r\nSimplified Acute Physiology Score\r\nsingle blind procedure\r\ntreatment duration\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nwithdrawal syndrome\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Najafi B, Shadnia S, Hassanian-Moghaddam H, Heydarian A, Mahdavinejad A, and Zamani N (2021) Fentanyl versus Methadone in Management of Withdrawal Syndrome in Opioid Addicted Patients; a Pilot Clinical Trial.

The present systematic review aims to examine how diverse groups have been included in U.S. randomized clinical trials examining pharmacological treatments (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) for OUDs. PubMed was systematically searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The initial search yielded 567 articles. After exclusion of ineligible articles, 50 remained for the present review. Of the included articles, 14.0% (n = 7) reported both full (i.e., accounting for all participants) sex/gender and race/ethnicity information; only two of those articles also included information about any SES indicators. Moreover, only 22.0% (n = 11) reported full sex/gender information, and 42.0% (n = 21) reported full racial/ethnic information. Furthermore, only 10.0% (n = 5) reported that their lack of subgroup analyses or diverse samples was a limitation to their studies. Particularly underrepresented were American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI), and multiracial individuals. These results also varied by medication type; Black individuals were underrepresented in buprenorphine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but were well represented in RCTs for methadone and/or naltrexone. In conclusion, it is critical that all people receive efficacious pharmacological care for OUDs given the ongoing opioid epidemic. Findings from the present review, however, support that participants from diverse or marginalized backgrounds are underrepresented in treatment trials, despite being at increased risk for disparities related to OUDs. Suggestions for future research are advanced.","Comments":"2021-11-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nalven T ; Spillane N S; Schick M R; Weyandt L L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1037/pha0000510","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nAlaska Native\r\nAmerican Indian\r\narticle\r\nAsian\r\nbiodiversity\r\nBlack person\r\ndrug efficacy\r\nepidemic\r\nethnicity\r\ngender\r\nhealth disparity\r\nhuman\r\ninformation processing\r\npeople of mixed ancestry\r\nNative Hawaiian\r\nopiate addiction\r\nPacific Islander\r\npatient care\r\npharmacological parameters\r\nrace\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrisk assessment\r\nstudy design\r\nsystematic review\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nalven T, Spillane N S, Schick M R, and Weyandt L L (2021) Diversity Inclusion in United States Opioid Pharmacological Treatment Trials: A Systematic Review.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the strength and consistency of findings in the medical literature regarding the association of prenatal exposure to MAT with early childhood cognitive development, particularly when accounting for variables outside MAT exposure. DATA SOURCES: A search strategy obtained publications from PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase from January 1972 to June 2019. Reference lists from identified articles were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were cohort studies, studies including children aged 1 to 60 months with at least 2 months of prenatal MAT exposure, studies using standardized direct-observation testing scales, and studies reporting means and SDs. Case reports, case series, historical controls, and reviews were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Data extracted included demographic characteristics, covariates, sources of bias, and effect estimates. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. This study was conducted according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Data extraction and synthesis were conducted between January 2018 and August 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cognitive test scores and demographic variability between exposed and unexposed groups. RESULTS: A total of 16 unique cohorts, described in 27 articles and including 1086 children (485 [44.7%] with MAT exposure), were included in a quantitative synthesis. On meta-analysis, MAT exposure was associated with lower cognitive development scores (pooled standardized mean difference, -0.57; 95% CI, -0.93 to -0.21; I2 = 81%). Multiple subanalyses on demographic characteristics (ie, maternal education, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, prenatal tobacco exposure, infant sex) were conducted. In the subanalysis of studies with comparable prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke, the association of MAT exposure with cognitive scores was no longer statistically significant and became homogeneous (standardized mean difference, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.42 to 0.20; I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, predefined subanalyses demonstrated how poor recruitment, particularly imbalances in maternal tobacco use, could contribute to a negative overall association of cognitive development test scores with prenatal MAT exposure. Promoting tobacco cessation for pregnant women with opioid use disorder should be prioritized in this high-risk population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nelson LF ; Yocum VK ; Patel KD ; Qeadan F ; Hsi A ; Weitzen S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.1195 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects\r\nBuprenorphine/adverse effects\r\nChild Development/drug effects\r\nChild, Preschool\r\nCognition/drug effects\r\nCognitive Dysfunction/*chemically induced\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMale\r\nMaternal Exposure/*adverse effects\r\nMethadone/adverse effects\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/drug therapy\r\nPrenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*psychology\r\nRisk Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nelson LF, Yocum VK, Patel KD, Qeadan F, Hsi A, and Weitzen S (2020) Cognitive Outcomes of Young Children After Prenatal Exposure to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis..

This review considered studies that have evaluated the impact of methadone maintenance treatment or buprenorphine therapy on sex- and drug-related HIV risk behaviors.Methods:Multiple databases were searched, including Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, OpenGrey, Grey Matters, New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Report, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Two reviewers independently assessed all titles and abstracts, and potentially relevant studies were retrieved in full. Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity. Data were then extracted from papers. Statistical pooling of quantitative data and meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of data.Results:Five articles were included in this review: three randomized controlled trials, one cohort study, and one quasi-experimental study. Four studies focused on methadone maintenance treatment and one study discussed the effectiveness of buprenorphine intervention. All studies were from the United States. One study enrolled participants in methadone maintenance treatment for heroin injectors, of which 10% of the sample was HIV positive. These papers included studies that reported a significant reduction in sex-related HIV risk behavior, including having multiple sex partners, frequency of sexual intercourse, condom use, prostitution, and sex trade. Of the five studies, two reported on drug-related HIV risk behaviors, citing a reduction in drug-related HIV risk behaviors. Also, these papers showed unexpected outcomes relating to frequency of sexual intercourse, prostitution, and sex trade. One study reported a significantly higher number of sexual encounters among persons not participating in treatment. One study reported decreasing prostitution and sex trade among individuals receiving methadone maintenance treatment intervention.Conclusion:Methadone maintenance treatment or buprenorphine therapy can be effective in reducing sex- and drug-related HIV risk behaviors among African, Caribbean, and Black people. However, due to the weaknesses in the body of evidence and the quality of evidence, it is not possible to make strong conclusions about these interventions. Rigorous studies are necessary to generate more findings and reinforce the body of literature.Systematic review registration number:PROSPERO CRD42019126954.","Comments":"2022-02-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nguemo Djiometio ; J B ; Buzuayew A ; Mohamud H ; Njoroge I ; Kahan M ; Nelson L E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.11124/JBIES-20-00223","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nadult\r\nAfrican\r\nBlack person\r\nCaribbean (person)\r\ncondom use\r\ndrug efficacy\r\nfemale\r\nhigh risk behavior\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nprostitution\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsexual intercourse\r\nsystematic review\r\nunsafe sex","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nguemo Djiometio, J B, Buzuayew A, Mohamud H, Njoroge I, Kahan M, and Nelson L E (2021) Effectiveness of opiate substitution treatment in reducing HIV risk behaviors among African, Caribbean, and Black people: A systematic review.

Although most research with buprenorphine has focused on heroin-dependent populations, we hypothesize that individuals dependent on PO display characteristics that may predict different outcomes in treatment, particularly in short-term taper procedures in which comorbidities such as pain conditions may complicate taper. METHODS: This secondary data analysis examined differences in outcomes between PO users (n = 90) and heroin users (n = 426) after a buprenorphine taper. Data were collected in a multisite randomized clinical trial conducted by the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network at 11 study sites across the United States. After a 4-week buprenorphine induction/stabilization phase, 516 opioid-dependent individuals were randomized into 1 of 2 taper lengths (7 vs 28 days) to assess the association between taper length and outcome. The primary outcome was measured by urine drug test for opioids at the end of the taper period. Craving, withdrawal, and buprenorphine dose were also examined. RESULTS: After controlling for baseline demographic and drug use differences between the opioid use groups, results indicate that a higher percentage of the PO group (49%) provided an opioid-free urine drug specimen at the end of taper compared with the heroin group (36%; χ(2)(1) = 6.592, P < 0.010). CONCLUSION: Short-term taper is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment; however, patients may taper from buprenorphine as part of a treatment plan. Despite greater comorbidity, PO users seem to have favorable taper outcomes compared with heroin users. Further studies are required to examine longer-term treatment outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nielsen S ; Hillhouse M ; Thomas C ; Hasson A ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0b013e318277e92e ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nDemography\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin/*pharmacology\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage\r\nNarcotics/pharmacology\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment/methods/statistics & numerical data\r\nSubstance Abuse Detection/methods\r\n*Substance-Related Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States/epidemiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nielsen S, Hillhouse M, Thomas C, Hasson A, and Ling W (2013) A comparison of buprenorphine taper outcomes between prescription opioid and heroin users..

Methods: The a search was conducted using the CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO.

Results: We identified six randomised controlled trials (607 participants). We found moderate quality evidence of no statistically significant difference in self-reported opioid use (RR 0.41, 95%CI 0.05-3.27) or opioid positive urine drug tests (RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.56-1.18) between buprenorphine and methadone. There was low quality evidence of no difference in retention between buprenorphine and methadone (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.30-1.31). There was low quality evidence favouring maintenance buprenorphine maintenance over detoxification or psychological treatment in terms of lower opioid use and less drop-out from treatment (RR 0.33, 95%CI 0.23-0.47). Conclusions: There is evidence supporting the use of maintenance agonist pharmacotherapy treatment for pharmaceutical opioid dependence. The current evidence suggests methadone and buprenorphine are equally effective.

To provide information for informing clinical responses, we undertook a systematic review of what is known about identifying and treating codeine dependence. Study design: Articles published in English that described people who were codeine-dependent or a clinical approach to treating people who were codeine-dependent, without restriction on year of publication, were reviewed. Articles not including empirical data were excluded. One researcher screened each abstract; two researchers independently reviewed full text articles. Study quality was assessed, and data were extracted with standardised tools. Data sources: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for relevant publications on 22 November 2016. The reference lists of eligible studies were searched to identify further relevant publications. 2150 articles were initially identified, of which 41 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. Data synthesis: Studies consistently reported specific characteristics associated with codeine dependence, including mental health comorbidity and escalation of codeine use attributed to psychiatric problems. Case reports and series described codeine dependence masked by complications associated with overusing simple analgesics and delayed detection. Ten studies described the treatment of codeine dependence. Three reports identified a role for behavioural therapy; the efficacy of CYP inhibitors in a small open label trial was not confirmed in a randomised controlled trial; four case series/chart reviews described opioid agonist therapy and medicated inpatient withdrawal; two qualitative studies identified barriers related to perceptions of codeine-dependent people and treatment providers, and confirmed positive perceptions and treatment outcomes achieved with opioid agonist treatments. Conclusion: Strategies for identifying problematic codeine use are needed. Identifying codeine dependence in clinical settings is often delayed, contributing to serious morbidity. Commonly described approaches for managing codeine dependence include opioid taper, opioid agonist treatment, and psychological therapies. These approaches are consistent with published evidence for pharmaceutical opioid dependence treatment and with broader frameworks for treating opioid dependence.

METHODS: We searched several databases (CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, PsychINFO, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database, Iran Medex, clinicaltrials.gov and who.int/trialsearch) with no language or publication date limitations. Two reviewers selected randomized controlled trials (RCT), cohort/case-control/cross-sectional studies and case-series on safety or efficacy of OT for treating opioid dependence and then extracted reported measures of mentioned outcomes from selected studies. We used the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment tool for appraisal. RESULTS: From nine selected studies; in three RCTs and one cohort analytical analysis on detoxification, 110 patients were treated with 15-140 morphine equivalents/day (mEq/d) of OT; in four prospective and one retrospective uncontrolled case-series on long-term/maintenance treatment, 570 patients were treated with 100-400 mEq/d of OT. Only two studies on detoxification included a comparison: one concluded equal efficacy of OT and methadone in suppressing withdrawal symptoms (P = 0.32) and the other concluded OT to be less efficacious than buprenorphine/naloxone in suppressing withdrawal [OT = 12.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11.00, 13.40]; control: 5.20 (95% CI = 4.69, 5.71) and craving (OT = 303.0, 95% CI = -144.664, 750.664; control: 0.0) but not significantly different (P = 0.26) in retaining participants in treatment. No major adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusive recommendations about the safety and efficacy of opium tincture for treating opioid dependence are not possible at this time.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nikoo M ; Nikoo N ; Anbardan SJ ; Amiri A ; Vogel M ; Choi F ; Sepehry AA ; Bagheri Valoojerdi AH; Jang K ; Schütz C ; Akhondzadeh S ; Krausz M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13628 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nOpium/*therapeutic use\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nMedication-assisted treatment\r\nopiate dependence\r\nopioid dependence\r\nopium\r\nreview\r\nsubstance use\r\ntincture of opium\r\ntreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nikoo M, Nikoo N, Anbardan SJ, Amiri A, Vogel M, Choi F, Sepehry AA, Bagheri Valoojerdi AH, Jang K, Schütz C, Akhondzadeh S, and Krausz M (2017) Tincture of opium for treating opioid dependence: a systematic review of safety and efficacy..

DESIGN: A Phase III, multi-centre, parallel-group, non-inferiority, double-blind randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Participants were provided treatment and followed for a period of 85 days. SETTING: Four OAT clinics in Iran. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and four participants with opioid use disorder [mean age (standard deviation) = 37.4 (9.3); female 11.3%] recruited between July 2017 and January 2018. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to either OT (102) or methadone (102) using a patient-centred flexible dosing strategy. MEASUREMENTS: Treatment retention over 85 days was the primary outcome. Self-reported opioid use outside treatment and occurrence of adverse events (AEs) were the secondary outcomes. FINDINGS: Remaining in treatment at the end of the follow-up were 68.6% in the methadone arm and 59.8% in the OT arm. The relative retention rate of methadone to OT was 1.15 (0.97, 1.36) in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses; non-inferiority was not supported statistically, as the upper bound of the confidence interval exceeded our pre-specified non-inferiority margin (1.25). Opioid use outside treatment was reported by 30.3% of OT (n = 152) and 49.4% of methadone (n = 168) patients, a difference in proportions of -19%: 90% confidence interval (-28%, -10%). The total count of AEs in the OT arm (22 among nine individuals) was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than that in the methadone arm (three among two individuals). Nausea was the most common side effect. CONCLUSION: While this study could not conclude the non-inferiority of opium tincture (OT) to methadone for retaining patients in opioid agonist treatment, OT retained 60% of participants to end of follow-up (85 days) and was superior to methadone in reducing self-reported opioid use outside treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nikoo M ; Kianpoor K ; Nikoo N ; Javidanbardan S ; Kazemi A ; Choi F ; Vogel M ; Gholami A ; Tavakoli S ; Wong JSH ; Moazen-Zadeh E ; Givaki R ; Jazani M ; Mohammadian F ; Moghaddam NM ; Schütz C ; Jang K ; Akhondzadeh S ; Krausz M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.16030 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nFemale\r\n*Methadone/therapeutic use\r\nOpium/therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nClinical trial\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid agonist treatment\r\nopioid substitution treatment\r\nopium\r\nopium tincture\r\nretention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nikoo M, Kianpoor K, Nikoo N, Javidanbardan S, Kazemi A, Choi F, Vogel M, Gholami A, Tavakoli S, Wong JSH, Moazen-Zadeh E, Givaki R, Jazani M, Mohammadian F, Moghaddam NM, Schütz C, Jang K, Akhondzadeh S, and Krausz M (2023) Opium tincture versus methadone for opioid agonist treatment: a randomized controlled trial..

DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed (1966 to March 2016) and EMBASE (1973 to March 2016) was completed using the search terms buprenorphine, methadone, pregnancy, opioid, and neonatal abstinence syndrome Priority was given to randomized controlled trials and trials directly comparing buprenorphine and methadone during pregnancy. The bibliographies were reviewed for other relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All human studies published in English, that compared methadone and buprenorphine use in pregnancy were evaluated. Because of the limited number of obstetric studies, only 5 critical studies were found. DATA SYNTHESIS: Buprenorphine significantly improved or had similar outcomes to methadone for development of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), percentage of infants requiring treatment for NAS (20%-47% vs 45.5%-57%, respectively), total amount of morphine used to treat NAS (0.472-3.4 vs 1.862-10.4 mg, respectively), duration of NAS (4.1-5.6 vs 5.3-9.9 days, respectively), peak NAS (3.9-11 vs 4.9-12.8 score, respectively), infant hospital stay (6.8-10.6 vs 8.1-17.5 days, respectively), and gestational age at delivery (38.8-39.7 vs 37.9-38.8 weeks, respectively). No difference was found with other neonatal or maternal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Both methadone and buprenorphine are effective agents, with improved safety compared with continued nonmedical opioid use during pregnancy. There is evidence to suggest that buprenorphine should be considered as an equivalent option to methadone for use in pregnancy; however, larger studies are still needed to fully evaluate buprenorphine safety and advantages over methadone in the obstetric population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Noormohammadi A ; Forinash A ; Yancey A ; Crannage E ; Campbell K ; Shyken J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/1060028016648367 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nLength of Stay\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome/*prevention & control\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nalcohol\r\nand substance abuse\r\ndrug\r\nobstetrics/gynecology\r\npregnancy/drug effects\r\nsubstance abuse\r\nwomen’s health","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Noormohammadi A, Forinash A, Yancey A, Crannage E, Campbell K, and Shyken J (2016) Buprenorphine Versus Methadone for Opioid Dependence in Pregnancy..

In Iran and other countries where opium use is common and culturally tolerated, opium tincture (OT) has gained growing popularity and been approved to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). Given the increasing interest in this intervention, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OT-assisted treatment for OUD. Methods: We systematically searched international (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov) and Iranian (Scientific Information Database (SID), Iranmedex, IranDoc, digital library of Iran's Drug Control Headquarters and the Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials) databases on November 04, 2020 without any language or publication date limitations. Two reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full-text of the retrieved records to find clinical trials or observational studies that assessed the safety and efficacy of OT-assisted treatment for OUD. Results: We screened 1301 records and included 21 unique studies on assisted withdrawal (n = 5), maintenance (n = 9), and gradual dose reduction (n = 7) treatment regimens. Most studies included men and people with opium use disorder. We found only six randomized controlled trials (RCT). Our results showed that OT-assisted treatment is associated with comparable outcomes with methadone treatment in both assisted withdrawal and maintenance treatment regimens. We also found promising results for using gradual dose reduction regimen of OT-assisted treatment from observational studies. The overall quality of scientific evidence was low due to the limited number RCT and high risk of bias in the included studies. Conclusions: The body of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of OT-assisted treatment in assisted withdrawal, maintenance, and gradual dose reduction regimens is limited but somewhat promising, in particular among people with opium use disorder. Our review calls for higher-quality studies to investigate the comparative efficacy of these treatment methods with standard pharmacotherapies for OUD.","Comments":"2021-12-13","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Noroozi A ; Kebriaeezadeh A ; Mirrahimi B ; Armoon B ; Ahounbar E ; Narenjiha H ; Salehi M ; Karamouzian M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108519","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nabstinence\r\nanxiety\r\ncognition\r\ndepression\r\ndrug dose reduction\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug safety\r\nGeneral Health Questionnaire-28\r\nhuman\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nMontreal cognitive assessment\r\nopiate addiction\r\npsychological well-being\r\nquality of life\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nRosenberg Self-Esteem Scale\r\nself esteem\r\nShort Form 36\r\nsleep quality\r\nsocial disability\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment withdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Noroozi A, Kebriaeezadeh A, Mirrahimi B, Armoon B, Ahounbar E, Narenjiha H, Salehi M, and Karamouzian M (2021) Opium tincture-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder: A systematic review.

The EHOST study is a cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial to evaluate a prescriber-focused intervention to increase HIV testing rates, and optimize ART engagement and retention outcomes among individuals engaged in OAT. The study will encompass all drug treatment clinics currently admitting patients for the treatment of opioid use disorder across the province of British Columbia, encompassing an estimated 90% of the OAT caseload. The trial will be executed over a 24-month period, with groups of clinics receiving the intervention in 6-month intervals. Evaluation of the proposed intervention's effectiveness will focus on three primary outcomes: (i) the HIV testing rate among those not known to be HIV positive; (ii) the rate of ART initiation among those not on ART; and (iii) the rate of ART continuation among those on ART. A difference-in-differences analytical framework will be applied to estimate the intervention's effect. This approach will assess site-specific changes in primary outcomes across clusters while adjusting for potential residual heterogeneity in patient case mix, volume, and quality of care across clinics.

The authors examined whether patients' demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with better response to one medication or the other. METHODS: In a multisite 24-week randomized comparative-effectiveness trial of assignment to buprenorphine-naloxone (N=287) compared with extended-release naltrexone (N=283) comprising inpatients planning to initiate medication treatment for opioid use disorder, 50 demographic and clinical characteristics were examined as moderators of the effect of medication assignment on relapse to regular opioid use and failure to initiate medication. Moderator-by-medication interactions were estimated using logistic regression with correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat sample, patients who reported being homeless had a lower relapse rate if they were assigned to receive extended-release naltrexone (51.6%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (70.4%) (odds ratio=0.45, 95% CI=0.22, 0.90); patients who were not homeless had a higher relapse rate if they were assigned to extended-release naltrexone (70.9%) compared with buprenorphine-naloxone (53.1%) (odds ratio=2.15, 95% CI=1.44, 3.21). In the subsample of patients who initiated medication, the interaction was not significant, with a similar pattern of lower relapse with extended-release naltrexone (41.4%) compared with buprenorphine (68.6%) among homeless patients (odds ratio=0.32, 95% CI=0.15, 0.68) but less difference among those not homeless (extended-release naltrexone, 57.2%; buprenorphine, 52.0%; odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI=0.80, 1.90). For failure to initiate medication, moderators were stated preference for medication (failure was less likely if the patient was assigned to the medication preferred), parole and probation status (fewer failures with extended-release naltrexone for those on parole or probation), and presence of pain and timing of randomization (more failure with extended-release naltrexone for patients endorsing moderate to severe pain and randomized early while still undergoing medically managed withdrawal). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with opioid use disorder admitted to inpatient treatment, homelessness, parole and probation status, medication preference, and factors likely to influence tolerability of medication initiation may be important in matching patients to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nunes EV Jr; Scodes JM ; Pavlicova M ; Lee JD ; Novo P ; Campbell ANC ; Rotrosen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20060816 ","Keywords":"Administration, Sublingual\r\nAdult\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nCriminal Justice\r\nExtended-Release Injection Naltrexone\r\nHomelessness\r\nNaltrexone Induction\r\nOpioid Use Disorder\r\nRelapse","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nunes EV Jr, Scodes JM, Pavlicova M, Lee JD, Novo P, Campbell ANC, and Rotrosen J (2021) Sublingual Buprenorphine-Naloxone Compared With Injection Naltrexone for Opioid Use Disorder: Potential Utility of Patient Characteristics in Guiding Choice of Treatment..

This systematic review aims to identify both protective factors supporting retention in OST, and risk factors for treatment dropout. Methods A systematic search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Web of Science (January 2001 to October 2019). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies reporting on retention rates and factors associated with retention in OST were included. Factors associated with treatment retention and dropout were explored according to the Maudsley Addiction Profile. A narrative synthesis is provided. Results 67 studies were included in this review (4 RCTs and 63 observational cohort studies; N = 294,592), all assessing factors associated with retention in OST or treatment dropout. The median retention rate across observational studies was approximately 57% at 12 months, which fell to 38.4% at three years. Studies included were heterogeneous in nature with respect to treatment setting, type of OST, risk factor assessment, ascertainment of outcome and duration of follow-up. While the presence of such methodological heterogeneity makes it difficult to synthesise results, there is limited evidence to support the influence of a number of factors on retention, including age, substance use, OST drug dose, legal issues, and attitudes to OST. Conclusions Younger age, substance use particularly cocaine and heroin use, lower doses of methadone, criminal activity/incarceration, and negative attitudes to MMT appear to be associated with reduced retention in OST. A consensus definition of retention is required to allow for comparability across future studies.","Comments":"2020-06-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"O’Connor A M; Cousins G ; Durand L ; Barry J ; Boland F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0232086","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ncocaine\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\ncause of death\r\ncohort analysis\r\ndrug retention\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmortality\r\nobservational study\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\npatient dropout\r\npublic health\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nreview\r\nrisk assessment\r\nrisk factor\r\nrisk reduction\r\nsocial psychology\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"O’Connor A M, Cousins G, Durand L, Barry J, and Boland F (2020) Retention of patients in opioid substitution treatment: A systematic review.

METHODS: Re-analyzed data from a 12-week multicenter, open-label, randomized treatment study with a subsequent 36-week open-label follow-up study. All patients, N = 143, had completed detoxification and received at least one dose of study medication. RESULTS: Of 143 patients (72% men), mean age 36 years, 71 received XR-NTX and 72 BP-NLX. The risk of first relapse and the risk of any relapse to heroin and other illicit opioids were both significantly lower in the XR-NTX group compared with the BP-NLX group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.76; P = .002, and HR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04-0.29; P < .001, respectively) and (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27; P < .001 and HR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.03-0.09; P < .001, respectively). There was a stable low risk of relapse among participants receiving XR-NTX in the follow-up. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared to BP-NLX, patients on XR-NTX had a substantially reduced risk of relapse to illicit opioids and showed a stable low risk of relapse over time in longer-term treatment. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our data support XR-NTX as a first-line treatment option for patients with opioid addiction both in short and longer-term treatment. This is the first European study showing that XR-NTX significantly reduces the risk of first and any relapse to heroin use in opioid-dependent patients compared to BP-NLX. Our data contradict previous data from the X:BOT study, showing no significant difference in relapse risk between the groups in a 6-month randomised controlled trial. (© 2021 Authors.

METHOD: A multicenter, outpatient, open-label randomized clinical trial where patients received intramuscular extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg/month, or daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone 8-24/2-6 mg for 12 weeks, and an option to continue with extended-release naltrexone for an additional 36 week follow-up. The study was conducted at five urban addiction clinics and detoxification units in Norway between November 2012, and July 2016. RESULTS: Among the 143 patients, 106 men and 37 women, there were no significant differences between those randomized to XR-NTX or BP-NLX in the risk of first relapse to alcohol (HR 1.31; 0.68-2.53), amphetamines (HR 0.88; 0.43-1.80), benzodiazepines (HR 1.24; 0.74-2.09) or cannabis (HR 1.55; 0.83-2.89). Also in the 36-week (12-48 weeks) follow-up period we found no significant differences between patients continuing with XR-NTX compared to those switching to XR-NTX after the randomized period in risk of first relapse to any non-opioid substance. In both study periods, the mean time in the study were longer among those relapsing to non-opioid addictive substances than those who did not. There was no significant association between first relapse to illicit opioids and first relapse to non-opioid addictive substances.

Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) including methadone and buprenorphine is the recommended management method for opioid use disorders during pregnancy. Methadone has been extensively studied during pregnancy; however, buprenorphine was introduced in the early 2000s with limited data on the use of different preparations during pregnancy. Buprenorphine-naloxone has been incorporated into routine practice; however, only a few studies have investigated the use of this medication during pregnancy. To determine the safety and efficacy of this medication, we conducted a systematic review of maternal and neonatal outcomes among buprenorphine-naloxone-exposed pregnancies. The primary outcomes of interest were birth parameters, congenital anomalies, and severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Secondary maternal outcomes included the OAT dose and substance use at delivery. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Buprenorphine-naloxone doses ranged between 8 and 20 mg, and there was an associated reduction of opioid use during pregnancy. There were no significant differences in gestational age at delivery, birth parameters, or prevalence of congenital anomalies between buprenorphine-naloxone-exposed neonates and those exposed to methadone, buprenorphine monotherapy, illicit opioids, or no opioids. In studies comparing buprenorphine-naloxone to methadone, there were reduced rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring pharmacotherapy. These studies demonstrate that buprenorphine-naloxone is a safe and effective opioid agonist treatment for pregnant people with OUD. Further large-scale, prospective data collection is required to confirm these findings. Patients and clinicians may be reassured about the use of buprenorphine-naloxone during pregnancy.","Comments":"2023-04-12","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ordean A ; Tubman-Broeren M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/pathophysiology30010004","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ncannabis\r\nillicit drug\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\nalcohol consumption\r\nbirth length\r\nbirth weight\r\nCanada\r\ncannabis use\r\nclinical decision making\r\nCochrane Library\r\ncommunity care\r\ncomparative study\r\ncongenital malformation\r\ndata analysis\r\ndata extraction\r\ndemographics\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug screening\r\ndrug urine level\r\nEmbase\r\nfemale\r\ngestational age\r\nhead circumference\r\nhuman\r\ninformation retrieval\r\nlength of stay\r\nMedline\r\nmonotherapy\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nobservational study\r\nobstetric delivery\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome assessment\r\noutpatient care\r\nparity\r\npatient counseling\r\npharmaceutical care\r\npractice guideline\r\npregnancy\r\npregnancy outcome\r\npregnant woman\r\npremature labor\r\nprevalence\r\nretrospective study\r\nreview\r\nrisk benefit analysis\r\nselection bias\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review\r\ntobacco use\r\ntreatment duration\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ordean A, and Tubman-Broeren M (2023) Safety and Efficacy of Buprenorphine-Naloxone in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review of the Literature.

As opioid misuse worsens, efforts are being made to increase access to medication-assisted treatments. Methadone is a medication-assisted treatment used to treat opioid dependence and chronic pain. While methadone is beneficial in the treatment of opiate abuse and chronic pain, side effects of the medication include hormonal and sexual function changes. The purpose of this report is to review the effects of methadone on the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis hormones and sexual functioning in males and females. METHODS: A search of PubMed was conducted using pre-defined criteria, resulting in the evaluation of 295 articles. A total of 72 articles, including 52 human studies and 20 animal studies, met the selection criteria and were reviewed. The included studies examined the effects of methadone on the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis and/or sexual function. RESULTS: There was evidence of methadone-induced hormonal changes, disruptions in the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis, and sexual dysfunction, although there was some variability in the results of the reviewed studies. Differences in methadone dose and length of exposure to treatment appears to influence the variability in the results. Much of the literature examines the effects of methadone in males, with very limited research examining the effects in females. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its effectiveness for opiate abuse and chronic pain treatment, methadone has disruptive effects on the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis and sexual function. Further research is warranted to better define potential methadone-induced endocrine consequences and to further examine the effects of methadone in females.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ortman HA ; Siegel JA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107823 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects\r\nAnimals\r\nChronic Pain/drug therapy\r\nFemale\r\nGonadal Disorders/*chemically induced\r\nHumans\r\nHypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*adverse effects\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nSexual Dysfunction, Physiological/*chemically induced\r\nEstrogens\r\nHPG axis\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioids\r\nSexual function\r\nTestosterone","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ortman HA, and Siegel JA (2020) The effect of methadone on the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis and sexual function: A systematic review..

METHODS: Randomized controlled 12-week trial of daily-observed methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone followed by a dose taper, referral to ongoing treatment, and follow-up at week 20 at the Uranti Clinic in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia. Eighty consenting treatment-seeking individuals (40/group) aged 25 and above who met ICD-10 criteria for opioid dependence with physiologic features and reported injecting buprenorphine 10 or more times in the past 30 days. Opioid use according to urine tests and self-reports, treatment retention, and HIV risk behavior as determined by the Risk Assessment Battery. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 33.7 (SD5.7), 4 were female, mean history of opioid injection use was 5.8 years (SD4.6), none were HIV+ at intake or at the 12-week assessment and 73.4% were HCV+. Sixty-eight participants (85%) completed the 12-week medication phase (33 from methadone and 35 from buprenorphine/naloxone group); 37 (46%) were in treatment at the 20-week follow-up (21 from methadone and 16 from the buprenorphine/naloxone group).

Mu1 opioid receptor (MOR),which is encoded by the OPRM1 gene,is the preferential binding target of methadone. Many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified within the OPRM1 gene. Some of these SNPs may influence methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and thus explain this variability. Objectives: Our purpose was to identify all relevant published studies having as objective the detection of correlations between OPRM1 SNPs and methadone required doses as well as the efficacy of MMT, then, to summarize results in order to evaluate the necessity of OPRM1 SNPs genotyping in opioid addicts prior to the onset of MMT. Methods: A systematic literature search of PUBMED was conducted to identify studies published until March 2015 using the following keyword combination (methadone or MMT) AND (mu1 or oprm1 or MOR or SNP or polymorphism or gene). All abstracts were reviewed to assess the relevance of the studies. We excluded duplicate papers and samples. Results: Our literature search yielded 333 articles. Eight of them were included in the review with a total of 1704 opioid addicts undergoing MMT. All of the studies are multicentric: Two are prospective, the other ones are retrospective. Subjects have different ethnic origins. The most focused on SNP was rs1799971(A118G). Results concerning its influence on doses and efficacy of methadone were conflicting. Five studies found no correlation between rs1799971 SNP and methadone required doses as well as the efficacy of MMT. One study concluded to that carriers of the G allele need higher methadone doses. The same result was reported by another study,however, this finding depended of the ABCB1 gene allele. Other OPRM1 SNPs might influence MMT. A study conducted in Taiwan suggested that subjects with the rs2075572 C allele require higher methadone doses. An association between poor response to methadone and the presence of GG-172 (rs6912029) or GG-1510 (rs12205732) genotypes was reported in individuals of Arab origins. Another study conducted among Jewish addicts found that carriers of the rs558025 G allele require lower methadone doses. Finally and according to a Spanish study, rs 1074287 doesn't seem to interfere with methadone pharmacodynamics. Conclusion: There is evidence that OPRM1 polymorphisms have an impact on MMT. Findings concerning Rs1799971 SNP are contradictory. Other SNPs might influence either response to methadone or its required dose, a duplication of these findings is needed.","Comments":"2016-01-15","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oueslati B ; Moula O ; Chebli S ; Smari N ; Triki R ; Ghachem R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"opiate\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate receptor\r\ngenetic polymorphism\r\ngene\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\ndrug dependence\r\nsystematic review\r\nEuropean\r\ncollege\r\npsychopharmacology\r\nallele\r\ngenotype\r\nethnic group\r\nhuman\r\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism\r\naddiction\r\nagonist\r\nTaiwan\r\npharmacodynamics\r\nArab","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oueslati B, Moula O, Chebli S, Smari N, Triki R, and Ghachem R (2015) Genetic polymorphisms of OPRM1 gene and their impact on methadone maintenance treatment in opioid addicts: A systematic review of the literature.

It is prescribed to patients with opioid-related use disorders. The OPRM1 gene encodes for methadone's main receptor. It appears that polymorphisms in OPRM1 may affect the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Objective: Our purpose was to identify all relevant published papers dealing with the impact ofOPRM1's SNPs on MMT's efficacy and to summarize results in order to evaluate the relevance of conducting pretherapeutic genotyping in opioid addicts prior to the onset of MMT. Methods: MEDLINE, PsychINFO and Scopus databases were systematically searched up to 1 January 2018 with no year restrictions using the following keyword combination (MMT) AND (mu or OPRM or mu opioid receptors or SNP or polymorphism or gene). Endpoint of the included studies had to be the impact of OPRM1 gene polymorphisms on the efficacy of MMT and/or methadone required doses during MMT. All abstracts were reviewed to assess papers' relevance. Studies conducted on animals and duplicate papers were excluded. Results: Our literature search identified 438 articles. Eight of them were included in our systematic review. The total number of included participants was equal to 2170, of whom 1718 underwent MMT. One study reported results of a randomized controlled trial. Three were designed as case-control studies and four as cross-sectional studies. rs1799971 (A118G) was the most studied allele. Results were divergent. Other SNPs might affect MMT's efficacy, however they were scarcely studied. Conclusion: Genotyping patients with opioid-related use disorders is a promising way to reach a better outcome in patients willing to be on MMT. Focusing on OPRM1 solely should be balanced since polymorphisms in other genes implicated in methadone pharmacodynamics and/or pharmacokinetics may conjunctly affect the efficacy of MMT. Recommendations cannot be enunciated for the moment.","Comments":"2018-06-08","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oueslati B ; Moula O ; Ghachem R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2217/pgs-2018-0017","Keywords":"methadone\r\nmu opiate receptor\r\nallele\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ngenetic association\r\ngenetic variation\r\ngenotype\r\nhuman\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\nOPRM1 gene\r\noutcome assessment\r\nreview\r\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oueslati B, Moula O, and Ghachem R (2018) The impact of OPRM1's genetic polymorphisms on methadone maintenance treatment in opioid addicts: A systematic review.

Furthermore, few studies evaluate response by gender. METHODS: The present analyses were performed using data from the NAOMI study, an open-label, phase III randomized controlled trial, carried out between 2005 and 2008 in Vancouver and Montreal, Canada. A total of 226 long-term treatment-refractory opioid dependent individuals were randomized to receive injectable diacetylmorphine or oral methadone for 12 months. Patients in both treatment groups were offered psychosocial and primary care services. Main outcomes were retention in addiction treatment at 12 months. Drug use, health, psychosocial adjustment and health-related quality of life were examined at baseline and during treatment, using the European Addiction Severity Index, Maudsley Addiction Profile, SF-6D and EuroQol EQ-5D. RESULTS: A total of 88 (38.9%) females and 138 (61.1%) males were included in the present analysis. Retention rates among female participants in the diacetylmorphine group were significantly higher than oral methadone (83.3% vs. 47.8%). Males receiving diacetylmorphine improved significantly more than females in physical health, health-related quality of life, and family relations but female participants in the diacetylmorphine group had significantly greater improvements in illicit drug use scores and psychological health compared to females allocated to oral methadone. CONCLUSIONS: Among long-term opioid dependent women who have not benefited sufficiently from available treatments, medically prescribed diacetylmorphine is more effective than oral methadone. Men receiving diacetylmorphine showed more improvements than women.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oviedo-Joekes E ; Guh D ; Brissette S ; Marchand K ; Marsh D ; Chettiar J ; Nosyk B ; Krausz M ; Anis A ; Schechter MT ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.03.016 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\nFemale\r\nHealth Status\r\nHeroin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotics/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*therapy\r\nPsychotherapy\r\nQuality of Life\r\nSex Factors\r\nStatistics, Nonparametric\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oviedo-Joekes E, Guh D, Brissette S, Marchand K, Marsh D, Chettiar J, Nosyk B, Krausz M, Anis A, and Schechter MT (2010) Effectiveness of diacetylmorphine versus methadone for the treatment of opioid dependence in women..

However, owing to political and regulatory barriers, it is not available in many settings around the world, which limits the options for many long-term street opioid injectors not attracted into or retained in available treatments. OBJECTIVE: To test if injectable hydromorphone hydrochloride is noninferior to injectable diacetylmorphine in reducing illicit heroin use for chronic injection opioid users after 6 months of intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness (SALOME) was a phase 3, double-blind, noninferiority trial. The study randomized 202 long-term street opioid injectors in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Eligible participants were recruited between December 19, 2011, and December 18, 2013. Both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive injectable diacetylmorphine or hydromorphone (up to 3 times daily) for 6 months under supervision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary and coprimary efficacy outcomes were self-reported days of street heroin use (primary), days of any street-acquired opioids in the prior 30 days (noninferiority margin, 4 days), and the proportion of urinalyses positive for street heroin markers (margin, 10% of the observed rate in the diacetylmorphine group). The mean differences between diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone for the ITT and PP analyses were reported. RESULTS: The study included 202 participants; 100 randomized to receive hydromorphone and 102 to diacetylmorphine. Their mean (SD) age was 44.33 (9.63) years, and 30.7% (62 of 202) were women. Noninferiority of hydromorphone was confirmed in the PP analysis (-1.44; 90% CI, -3.22 to 0.27) for street heroin use, although the margin of 4 days was not excluded in the ITT analysis (-2.34; 90% CI, -4.14 to -0.52). Noninferiority was confirmed for any street opioids in the ITT analysis (-0.85; 90% CI, -2.97 to 1.25) and the PP analysis (-0.15; 90% CI, -2.09 to 1.76), as well as for the urinalyses (0.09; 90% CI, -0.02 to 0.19 for the ITT analysis and 0.13; 90% CI, 0.02-0.24 for the PP analysis). There were 29 SAEs considered to have some relationship with the injection medication, 5 in the hydromorphone group and 24 in the diacetylmorphine group (rate ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.69). Seizures and overdoses accounted for 25 of the 29 related SAEs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides evidence to suggest noninferiority of injectable hydromorphone relative to diacetylmorphine for long-term opioid dependence. In jurisdictions where diacetylmorphine is currently not available or for patients in whom it is contraindicated or unsuccessful, hydromorphone could be offered as an alternative.

The variability in response to methadone has been widely recognized. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the pharmacogenetic factors underlying this variability. Materials & methods: This is a narrative overview of the literature on the genetic variants affecting pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of methadone, retrieved from searches of databases such as PubMed and google scholar. Discussion: Clinical responses to methadone may be affected by genetic variants in the opioidergic, dopaminergic and neurotrophic pathways. Polymorphisms in genes related to disposition and elimination of methadone alter the pharmacokinetics, and possibly pharmacodynamics of methadone. Cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein variants contribute to the interindividual variability in methadone pharmacokinetics. Evidence for single gene variants affecting methadone response remains weak. Multiple genetic variants must be considered in conjunction to improve predictive ability. Conclusion: Evidence remains scarce at this time, to recommend pharmacogenetic testing before methadone administration. Well-powered clinical studies are needed with population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and multigenetic signature-based predictions to enable tailored use of methadone in clinical practice.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Packiasabapathy S ; Aruldhas BW ; Horn N ; Overholser BR ; Quinney SK ; Renschler JS ; Sadhasivam S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2217/pgs-2020-0040 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nAnimals\r\nGenetic Variation/*genetics\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics\r\nPharmacogenetics/*methods\r\ngene variants\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid\r\nopioid maintenance therapy\r\npersonalized analgesia\r\npharmacodynamics\r\npharmacogenetics\r\npharmacogenomics\r\npharmacokinetics\r\npolymorphism","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Packiasabapathy S, Aruldhas BW, Horn N, Overholser BR, Quinney SK, Renschler JS, and Sadhasivam S (2020) Pharmacogenomics of methadone: a narrative review of the literature..

The purpose of this study was to examine MOUD initiation onto buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) versus extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) by sex, and sex differences in clinical and psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: Using data from a 24-week open-label comparative effectiveness trial of BUP-NX or XR-NTX, this study examined MOUD initiation (i.e., receiving a minimum one XR-NTX injection or first BUP-NX dose) and 24-week self-report outcomes. We used regression models to estimate the probability of MOUD initiation failure among the intent-to-treat sample (N = 570), and the main and interaction effects of sex on outcomes of interest among the subsample of participants who successfully initiated MOUD (n = 474). RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat sample, the odds of treatment initiation failure were not significantly different by sex. In the subsample of successful MOUD initiates, the effect of treatment on employment at week 24 was significantly moderated by sex (p = .003); odds of employment were not significantly different among males by MOUD type; females randomized to XR-NTX versus BUP-NX had 4.63 times greater odds of employment (p < .001). Males had significantly lower odds of past 30-day exchanging sex for drugs versus females (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] = 0.10, p = .004), controlling for treatment and baseline outcomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Further research should explore how to integrate employment support into OUD treatment to improve patient outcomes, particularly among women.

She was given increasing microdoses of buprenorphine over a 7-day period, while continuing her daily dose of methadone. She discontinued the methadone on day 8. She did well during the week of buprenorphine microdosing, with no complaints of withdrawal or cravings. She was engaged in her prenatal care. Her dose of buprenorphine was increased to 8 mg twice daily in the third trimester for some withdrawal symptoms in the evening consisting of new onset nausea and vomiting. The patient underwent an elective 39-week induction of labor and had a spontaneous vaginal delivery of an appropriately grown male fetus. Only nonpharmacologic interventions were used. Conclusion Buprenorphine microdosing was well tolerated in this patient and avoided withdrawal symptoms in the mothers, and NOWS.

This is especially true during the early stages of treatment. METHODS: The present study proposes to utilize a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial design to compare two psychological interventions targeting buprenorphine-naloxone adherence: (1) contingency management (CM) and (2) brief motivational interviewing plus substance-free activities session plus mindfulness (BSM). Participants will be N = 280 adults who present to a university-based addictions clinic seeking treatment for OUD. Participants will be randomized to condition to receive 4 sessions of their assigned intervention (CM or BSM). Participants who are adherent, defined as attending physician appointments and having buprenorphine present in urine toxicology, will enter maintenance intervention for an additional 6 months. Those who are not adherent will be re-randomized to receive either the other intervention or both interventions. Follow-up will occur at 8 months post-randomization. CONCLUSIONS: This novel design will examine the benefit of sequential treatment decisions following non-adherence. The primary outcome of this study is buprenorphine-naloxone medication adherence, as assessed by physician visit attendance and presence of buprenorphine in urine. Results will elicit the relative efficacy of CM and BSM compared to one another and whether keeping the initial treatment approach when adding the alternative approach for initially non-adherent individuals is beneficial.

When compared to urban centres, rural and remote populations face additional barriers to treatment, including geographical distance as well as chronic shortages of health care professionals. This integrative review of the literature was conducted to explore the facilitators and barriers of OAT in rural and remote Canadian communities. METHODS: A search of the literature identified relevant studies published between 2001 and 2021. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 26 scholarly peer-reviewed publications, which explored specific barriers and facilitators to rural and remote OAT in Canada, along with two reports and one fact sheet from the grey literature. Most of the scholarly articles were descriptive studies (n = 14) or commentaries (n = 9); there were only three intervention studies. Facilitators and barriers to OAT programs were organized into six themes: intrapersonal/patient factors, social/non-medical program factors, family/social context factors (including community factors), infrastructure/environmental factors, health care provider factors, and system/policy factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although themes in the literature resembled the social-ecological framework, most of the studies focused on the patient-provider dyad. Two of the most compelling studies focused on community factors that positively impacted OAT success and highlighted a holistic approach to care, nested in a community-based holistic model. Further research is required to foster OAT programs in rural and remote communities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pijl EM ; Alraja A ; Duff E ; Cooke C ; Dash S ; Nayak N ; Lamoureux J ; Poulin G ; Knight E ; Fry B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s13011-022-00463-5 ","Keywords":"*Analgesics, Opioid\r\nCanada\r\nHumans\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders\r\nPopulation Groups\r\nRural Population\r\nCommunity health services\r\nIntegrative review\r\nOpioid agonist\r\nOpioid epidemic\r\nOpioid-related disorders\r\nRural population","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pijl EM, Alraja A, Duff E, Cooke C, Dash S, Nayak N, Lamoureux J, Poulin G, Knight E, and Fry B (2022) Barriers and facilitators to opioid agonist therapy in rural and remote communities in Canada: an integrative review..

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Bibliographic databases were searched for studies measuring concurrent exposure to current OST (within the last 6 months) and/or NSP and HCV incidence among PWID. High NSP coverage was defined as regular NSP attendance or ≥ 100% coverage (receiving sufficient or greater number of needles and syringes per reported injecting frequency). Studies were assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias in non-randomized studies tool. Random-effects models were used in meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified 28 studies (n = 6279) in North America (13), United Kingdom (five), Europe (four), Australia (five) and China (one). Studies were at moderate (two), serious (17) critical (seven) and non-assessable risk of bias (two). Current OST is associated with 50% [risk ratio (RR) =0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40-0.63] reduction in HCV acquisition risk, consistent across region and with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 0, P = 0.889). Weaker evidence was found for high NSP coverage (RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.39-1.61) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 77%, P = 0.002). After stratifying by region, high NSP coverage in Europe was associated with a 56% reduction in HCV acquisition risk (RR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.24-0.80) with low heterogeneity (I(2) = 12.3%, P = 0.337), but not in North America (RR = 1.58, I(2) = 89.5%, P = < 0.001). Combined OST/NSP is associated with a 74% reduction in HCV acquisition risk (RR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.07-0.89, I(2) = 80% P = 0.007). According to Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, the evidence on OST and combined OST/NSP is low quality, while NSP is very low. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid substitution therapy reduces risk of hepatitis C acquisition and is strengthened in combination with needle and syringe programmes (NSP). There is weaker evidence for the impact of needle syringe programmes alone, although stronger evidence that high coverage is associated with reduced risk in Europe.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Platt L ; Minozzi S ; Reed J ; Vickerman P ; Hagan H ; French C ; Jordan A ; Degenhardt L ; Hope V ; Hutchinson S ; Maher L ; Palmateer N ; Taylor A ; Bruneau J ; Hickman M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.14012 ","Keywords":"Australia/epidemiology\r\nChina/epidemiology\r\nComorbidity\r\nDatabases, Factual\r\nEurope/epidemiology\r\nHepatitis C/*epidemiology/*prevention & control\r\nHumans\r\nInternationality\r\nNeedle-Exchange Programs/*statistics & numerical data\r\nNorth America/epidemiology\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*statistics & numerical data\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*epidemiology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited Kingdom/epidemiology\r\nCochrane\r\nharm reduction\r\nhepatitis C\r\nincidence\r\nmeta-analysis\r\nneedle and syringe programmes\r\nopioid substitution therapy\r\nreview\r\nsubstance use","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Platt L, Minozzi S, Reed J, Vickerman P, Hagan H, French C, Jordan A, Degenhardt L, Hope V, Hutchinson S, Maher L, Palmateer N, Taylor A, Bruneau J, and Hickman M (2018) Needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy for preventing HCV transmission among people who inject drugs: findings from a Cochrane Review and meta-analysis..

METHOD: A total of 1,269 participants (32.2% female) were randomized to receive one of two study medications (methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone [BUP]). Of these, 731 participants completed the 24-week active medication phase. Treatment outcomes were opioid use during the final 30 days of treatment (among treatment completers) and treatment attrition. RESULTS: Non-opioid substance dependence diagnoses and injecting differentiated heroin and combined users from OA users. Non-opioid substance dependence diagnoses and greater heroin use differentiated injectors from non-injectors. Further, injectors were more likely to be using at end of treatment compared with non-injectors. OA users were more likely to complete treatment compared with heroin users and combined users. Non-injectors were more likely than injectors to complete treatment. There were no interactions between type of opioid used or injection status and treatment assignment (methadone or BUP) on either opioid use or treatment attrition. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that substance use severity differentiates heroin users from OA users and injectors from non-injectors. Irrespective of medication, heroin use and injecting are associated with treatment attrition and opioid misuse during treatment. These results have particular clinical interest, as there is no evidence of superiority of BUP over methadone for treating OA users versus heroin users.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Potter JS ; Marino EN ; Hillhouse MP ; Nielsen S ; Wiest K ; Canamar CP ; Martin JA ; Ang A ; Baker R ; Saxon AJ ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.15288/jsad.2013.74.605 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/*rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaloxone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/epidemiology/rehabilitation\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Potter JS, Marino EN, Hillhouse MP, Nielsen S, Wiest K, Canamar CP, Martin JA, Ang A, Baker R, Saxon AJ, and Ling W (2013) Buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone maintenance treatment outcomes for opioid analgesic, heroin, and combined users: findings from starting treatment with agonist replacement therapies (START)..

New pathways are required to increase access to treatment amongst people prescribed opioid substitution therapy (OST). METHODS: An exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial with mixed methods evaluation was undertaken to compare the uptake of dried blood spot testing (DBST) and treatment of people with genotype 1 HCV infection in a conventional service pathway versus a pharmacist-led pathway in a population receiving OST. RESULTS: Pharmacies randomised to the conventional pathway obtained 58 DBST from 244 patients (24%):15 new reactive tests and 33 new negative tests were identified. Within the pharmacist-led pathway, 94 DBST were obtained from 262 patients (36%): 26 new reactive tests and 54 new negative tests were identified. Participants in the pharmacist-led pathway were more likely to take a DBST (p<0.003). Of participants referred for treatment through the conventional pathway, 4 patients from 15 with new reactive tests (27%) attended clinic for assessment. In the pharmacist-led treatment pathway, 20 patients from 26 with new reactive tests (77%) attended for assessment blood tests. Participants in the pharmacist-led pathway were more likely to proceed through the assessment for treatment (p<0.002). One participant completed treatment through the conventional pathway and three patients completed treatment through the pharmacist-led pathway. The process evaluation identified key themes important to service user completers and staff participants. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that testing and treatment for HCV in a pharmacist led-pathway is a feasible treatment pathway for people who receive supervised OST consumption through community pharmacies. This feasibility trial therefore provides sufficient confirmation to justify proceeding to a full trial.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Radley A ; Tait J ; Dillon JF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2017.05.042 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nAntiviral Agents/*therapeutic use\r\nCommunity Pharmacy Services/*statistics & numerical data\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHepatitis C/blood/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nHepatitis C Antibodies/blood\r\nHumans\r\nInterferon-alpha/therapeutic use\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*statistics & numerical data\r\nPharmacists\r\nRibavirin/*therapeutic use\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/blood/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nYoung Adult\r\nClinical pathways\r\nCommunity pharmacy\r\nDirectly acting antiviral drugs\r\nFeasibility trial\r\nHepatitis C","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Radley A, Tait J, and Dillon JF (2017) DOT-C: A cluster randomised feasibility trial evaluating directly observed anti-HCV therapy in a population receiving opioid substitute therapy from community pharmacy..

In conventional care, less than 10% of OST users are tested for HCV and less than 25% of these initiate treatment. Community pharmacists see this group frequently to provide OST supervision. This study examines whether a pharmacist-led 'test & treat' pathway increases cure rates for HCV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol describes a cluster-randomised trial where 60 community pharmacies provide either conventional or pharmacy-led care. All pharmacies offer dried blood spot testing (DBST) for HCV. Participants have attended the pharmacy for OST for 3 months; are positive for HCV genotype 1 or 3; are not co-infected with HIV and/or hepatitis B; have no decompensated liver disease; are not pregnant. For conventional care, pharmacists refer HCV-positive participants to a local centre for assessment. In the pharmacy-led arm, pharmacists assess participants themselves in the pharmacy. Drug prescribing is by nurse prescribers (conventional arm) or pharmacist prescribers (pharmacy-led arm). Treatment in both arms is delivered as daily modified directly observed therapy in a pharmacy. Primary trial outcome is number of sustained virological responses at 12 weeks after treatment completion. Secondary trial outcomes are number of tests taken; treatment uptake; completion; adherence; re-infection. An economic evaluation will assess potential cost-effectiveness. Qualitative research interviews with clients and health professionals assess acceptability of a pharmacist-led pathway. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been ethically approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Committee 2 (15/ES/0086) and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and principles of Good Clinical Practice. Caldicott guardian approval was given on 16 December 2016 to allow NHS Tayside to pass information to the cluster community pharmacies about the HCV test status of patients that they are seeing to provide OST supervision. NHS R&D approvals have been obtained from each health board taking part in the study. Informed consent is obtained before study enrolment and only anonymised data are stored in a secured database, enabling an audit trail.

Systematic reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness of such therapies. Opium dependence is associated with less problems and impairments and is less likely to be used by injecting, with consequent reductions in risk of overdose and blood-borne diseases. Although it is a common substance use disorder in many countries, a systematic review of the literature is lacking on the maintenance treatment for opium dependence. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of various pharmacological therapies on maintenance of opium dependence (alone or in combination with psychosocial interventions) compared to no intervention, detoxification, different doses of the same intervention, other pharmacologic interventions and any psychosocial interventions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following sources up to February 2012: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, regional databases (IMEMR and ASCI), national databases (Iranmedex and Iranpsych), main electronic sources of ongoing trials and reference lists of all relevant papers. Also, we contacted known investigators from some Asian countries to obtain details about unpublished trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing any maintenance pharmacologic intervention versus no intervention, other pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic intervention for opium dependence. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers assessed the risks of biases and extracted data, independently. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs recruiting 870 opium dependents were included. The studies made different comparisons so it was not possible to pool data. Only retention rate was assessed by the studies. Two studies compared different doses of buprenorphine: in one study, 4 mg/day of buprenorphine was compared with doses of 2 mg/day and 1 mg/day and in another study, 8 mg/day of buprenorphine was compared with doses of 3 mg/day and 1 mg/day. Comparisons showed a statistically significant difference between groups; higher doses of buprenorphine increased the probability of retention in treatment. The studies had high risks of biases. In the third study, after a process of detoxification, baclofen (60 mg/day) was compared with placebo for maintenance treatment. The difference in retention rate between groups was high, but it was not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to conclude about the use of any kind of pharmacologic therapies for maintenance treatment of opium dependence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rahimi-Movaghar A ; Amin-Esmaeili M ; Hefazi M ; Yousefi-Nooraie R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD007775.pub2 ","Keywords":"Baclofen/administration & dosage\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nHumans\r\nMaintenance Chemotherapy/*methods\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rahimi-Movaghar A, Amin-Esmaeili M, Hefazi M, and Yousefi-Nooraie R (2013) Pharmacological therapies for maintenance treatments of opium dependence..

Material & methods: Forty five male drug addicts; 25 from Lahore and 20 from Peshawar were included in the study. After detoxification, each patient was given 50 mg of Naltrexone daily under supervision of a care giver. Each patient was followed for 24 weeks. Results: On completion of the trial, 13 patients (28.9%) had relapsed while 71.1% were still abstinent as judged by Thin Layer Chromatography of urine. LFTs remained normal in all cases. Headache was the most frequent (29.7%) side effect followed by anxiety (27.4%) and loss of energy (25.3%). Conclusion: A high rate of abstinence (71.1%) coupled with a low incidence of side effects makes Naltrexone an acceptable mode of treatment for opioid dependence.","Comments":"2012-11-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rashid S ; Saleem F ; Hanif S ; Imam H ; Omer S M; Farooq M ; Waris A A; Rashid M H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"naltrexone\r\nadult\r\nanxiety disorder\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical trial\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug induced headache\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nintervention study\r\nmale\r\nopen study\r\nopiate addiction\r\nprospective study\r\nrelapse\r\nthin layer chromatography","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rashid S, Saleem F, Hanif S, Imam H, Omer S M, Farooq M, Waris A A, and Rashid M H (2012) Efficacy of naltrexone in preventing relapse in opioid dependent patients.

DESIGN: Twelve-month open-label randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Out-patient substitution clinics in seven German cities. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1015 opiate-dependent individuals. MEASUREMENTS: Opiate Treatment Index-Health Scale Score (OTI), Body Mass Index (BMI), serology for infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, C and human immunodeficiency virus as well as tuberculosis, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Modular System for Quality of Life and study medication-related serious adverse events (SAE). FINDINGS: Improvements were found in both heroin and methadone substituted patients regarding OTI, BMI, KPS, SCL-90-R, and GAF, but they were more pronounced for the heroin group (analysis of variance, all P = 0.000). The frequency of pathological echocardiograms decreased in the heroin group and increased in the methadone group (χ(2) test, <0.05). Markers for infectious diseases and frequencies of pathological ECGs did not differ between baseline and 12 months, or between treatment groups. Study medication-related serious adverse events, all of which were treated successfully, occurred 2.5 times more often in the heroin group. The majority of heroin-related SAEs (41 of 58) occurred within a few minutes of the injections. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of severe injection drug users either in methadone or heroin-assisted maintenance treatment has positive effects on most physical and mental change-sensitive variables, with heroin showing superior results. Due to medication-related adverse events, patients should be observed for 15 minutes after a heroin injection.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reimer J ; Verthein U ; Karow A ; Schäfer I ; Naber D ; Haasen C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03463.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use\r\nAnalysis of Variance\r\nBody Mass Index\r\nEchocardiography\r\nElectrocardiography\r\nFemale\r\nGermany\r\nHealth Status\r\nHealth Status Indicators\r\nHeroin/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMental Health/*statistics & numerical data\r\nMethadone/adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/epidemiology/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nQuality of Life/psychology\r\nSerologic Tests\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Centers\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/epidemiology/psychology/*rehabilitation\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reimer J, Verthein U, Karow A, Schäfer I, Naber D, and Haasen C (2011) Physical and mental health in severe opioid-dependent patients within a randomized controlled maintenance treatment trial..

However, PWID are considered \"difficult to treat,\" requiring a specifically adapted treatment setting, including psychosocial support. METHODS: In this prospective, German trial, the impact of psychoeducation (PE) on retention and sustained virologic response (SVR) during HCV therapy among PWID was evaluated. We included 198 patients in opiate substitution therapy, who fulfilled indications for antiviral treatment. All patients received pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy. Patients in the intervention group (n = 82) received manualized PE sessions. RESULTS: In patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 (GT 1/4), PE was associated with increased treatment completion (76% vs 55%, P = .038), whereas PE had no such effect among GT 2/3 patients, who showed fewer dropouts and higher SVR rates. Among GT 1/4 patients, a minimum of 5 PE sessions was associated with increased SVR (71% vs 48%, P = .037). Multivariate regression analyses confirmed the impact of PE in GT 1/4 and revealed further predictors for retention and SVR, such as preexisting mental distress and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a higher risk of dropout due to GT 1/4 or mental distress, PE was shown to improve retention and SVR. PE is an effective supportive intervention for HCV therapy among PWID.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reimer J ; Schmidt CS ; Schulte B ; Gansefort D ; Gölz J ; Gerken G ; Scherbaum N ; Verthein U ; Backmund M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/cid/cit307 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAntiviral Agents/administration & dosage\r\nBehavior Therapy/*methods\r\nFemale\r\nGermany\r\nHepatitis C/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nInterferon-alpha/administration & dosage\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nPolyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage\r\nProspective Studies\r\nRecombinant Proteins/administration & dosage\r\nRibavirin/administration & dosage\r\nSubstance Abuse, Intravenous/*complications/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nViral Load\r\nYoung Adult\r\nantiviral treatment\r\nhepatitis C\r\ninjection drug users\r\npsychoeducation\r\nretention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reimer J, Schmidt CS, Schulte B, Gansefort D, Gölz J, Gerken G, Scherbaum N, Verthein U, and Backmund M (2013) Psychoeducation improves hepatitis C virus treatment during opioid substitution therapy: a controlled, prospective multicenter trial..

However, controlled drugs used in treatment may be misused or diverted, resulting in negative treatment outcomes. This review defines a framework to assess the impact of misuse and diversion. METHODS: A systematic review of published studies of misuse and diversion of OST medicines was completed; this evidence was paired with expert real-world experience to better understand the impact of misuse and diversion on the individual and on society. RESULTS: Direct impact to the individual includes failure to progress in recovery and negative effects on health (overdose, health risks associated with injecting behaviour). Diversion of OST has impacts on a community that is beyond the intended OST recipient. The direct impact includes risk to others (unsupervised use; unintended exposure of children to diverted medication) and drug-related criminal behavior. The indirect impact includes the economic costs of untreated opioid dependence, crime and loss of productivity. CONCLUSION: While treatment for opioid dependence is essential and must be supported, it is vital to reduce misuse and diversion while ensuring the best possible care. Understanding the impact of OST misuse and diversion is key to defining strategies to address these issues.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reimer J ; Wright N ; Somaini L ; Roncero C ; Maremmani I ; McKeganey N ; Littlewood R ; Krajci P ; Alho H ; D'Agnone O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000438988 ","Keywords":"Consensus\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPrescription Drug Diversion/*economics\r\nPrescription Drug Misuse/*adverse effects/*economics","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reimer J, Wright N, Somaini L, Roncero C, Maremmani I, McKeganey N, Littlewood R, Krajci P, Alho H, and D'Agnone O (2016) The Impact of Misuse and Diversion of Opioid Substitution Treatment Medicines: Evidence Review and Expert Consensus..

In collaboration with people with lived experience, clinicians, and policy makers, we sought to assess the relative benefits of psychosocial interventions as an adjunct to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) among persons with OUD. METHODS: A review protocol was registered a priori (CRD42018090761), and a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCT) was conducted from database inception to June 2020 in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Established methods for study selection and data extraction were used. Primary outcomes were treatment retention and opioid use (measured by urinalysis for opioid use and opioid abstinence outcomes). Odds ratios were estimated using network meta-analyses (NMA) as appropriate based on available evidence, and in remaining cases alternative approaches to synthesis were used. RESULTS: Seventy-two RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias evaluations commonly identified study limitations and poor reporting with regard to methods used for allocation concealment and selective outcome reporting. Due to inconsistency in reporting of outcome measures, only 48 RCTs (20 unique interventions, 5,404 participants) were included for NMA of treatment retention, where statistically significant differences were found when psychosocial interventions were used as an adjunct to OAT as compared to OAT-only. The addition of rewards-based interventions such as contingency management (alone or with community reinforcement approach) to OAT was superior to OAT-only. Few statistically significant differences between psychosocial interventions were identified among any other pairwise comparisons. Heterogeneity in reporting formats precluded an NMA for opioid use. A structured synthesis was undertaken for the remaining outcomes which included opioid use (n = 18 studies) and opioid abstinence (n = 35 studies), where the majority of studies found no significant difference between OAT plus psychosocial interventions as compared to OAT-only. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the available evidence and the limitations of current trials of psychosocial interventions applied as an adjunct to OAT for OUD. Clinicians and health services may wish to consider integrating contingency management in addition to OAT for OUD in their settings to improve treatment retention. Aside from treatment retention, few differences were consistently found between psychosocial interventions adjunctive to OAT and OAT-only. There is a need for high-quality RCTs to establish more definitive conclusions.

When people who are receiving methadone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence are incarcerated in prison or jail, most US correctional facilities discontinue their methadone treatment, either gradually, or more often, abruptly. This discontinuation can cause uncomfortable symptoms of withdrawal and renders prisoners susceptible to relapse and overdose on release. We aimed to study the effect of forced withdrawal from methadone upon incarceration on individuals' risk behaviours and engagement with post-release treatment programmes. METHODS: In this randomised, open-label trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) inmates of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RI, USA) who were enrolled in a methadone maintenance-treatment programme in the community at the time of arrest and wanted to remain on methadone treatment during incarceration and on release, to either continuation of their methadone treatment or to usual care--forced tapered withdrawal from methadone. Participants could be included in the study only if their incarceration would be more than 1 week but less than 6 months. We did the random assignments with a computer-generated random permutation, and urn randomisation procedures to stratify participants by sex and race. Participants in the continued-methadone group were maintained on their methadone dose at the time of their incarceration (with dose adjustments as clinically indicated). Patients in the forced-withdrawal group followed the institution's standard withdrawal protocol of receiving methadone for 1 week at the dose at the time of their incarceration, then a tapered withdrawal regimen (for those on a starting dose >100 mg, the dose was reduced by 5 mg per day to 100 mg, then reduced by 3 mg per day to 0 mg; for those on a starting dose >100 mg, the dose was reduced by 3 mg per day to 0 mg). The main outcomes were engagement with a methadone maintenance-treatment clinic after release from incarceration and time to engagement with methadone maintenance treatment, by intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses, which we established in a follow-up interview with the participants at 1 month after their release from incarceration. Our study paid for 10 weeks of methadone treatment after release if participants needed financial help. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01874964. FINDINGS: Between June 14, 2011, and April 3, 2013, we randomly assigned 283 prisoners to our study, 142 to continued methadone treatment, and 141 to forced withdrawal from methadone. Of these, 60 were excluded because they did not fit the eligibility criteria, leaving 114 in the continued-methadone group and 109 in the forced-withdrawal group (usual care). Participants assigned to continued methadone were more than twice as likely than forced-withdrawal participants to return to a community methadone clinic within 1 month of release (106 [96%] of 110 in the continued-methadone group compared with 68 [78%] of 87 in the forced-withdrawal group; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2·04, 95% CI 1·48-2·80). We noted no differences in serious adverse events between groups. For the continued-methadone and forced-withdrawal groups, the number of deaths were one and zero, non-fatal overdoses were one and two, admissions to hospital were one and four; and emergency-room visits were 11 and 16, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Although our study had several limitations--eg, it only included participants incarcerated for fewer than 6 months, we showed that forced withdrawal from methadone on incarceration reduced the likelihood of prisoners re-engaging in methadone maintenance after their release. Continuation of methadone maintenance during incarceration could contribute to greater treatment engagement after release, which could in turn reduce the risk of death from overdose and risk behaviours.

Patients previously on high-dose opioids may poorly tolerate opioid tapers. Current guidelines support the use of buprenorphine therapy in opioid-tapering protocols, even among patients without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine microinduction protocols can be used to transition patients to buprenorphine therapy without opioid withdrawal. From November 2019 to April 2020, we transitioned 8 patients on high-dose prescribed opioids for pain to sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone using a microdose protocol without any evidence of precipitated withdrawal. Six of these patients remain on buprenorphine-naloxone and report improved analgesia. Because of its simplicity, the buprenorphine microinduction protocol can be easily adapted for telemedicine and may help to prevent unnecessary clinic visits and opioid-related admissions in the setting of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

Interventions that can increase the uptake of OST and/or re-engage people in treatment could become an important component of harm reduction. A systematic literature review was conducted for studies of interventions designed to increase the uptake of OST. METHODS: Searches were conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycInfo and CINHAL. We concentrated on an adult population in a community setting and English language studies. RESULTS: Eighty nine studies were identified after filtering search results, of which, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were broadly categorized into motivational interventions (MI), case management (CM) or mixed approaches. Meta-analysis was performed on six studies investigating MI and two studies investigating CM interventions. Individuals exposed to MI were 1.46 times more likely to enter treatment at follow-up (95% CI: 1.14-1.86, P = 0.003) and individuals exposed to CM were 2.95 times more likely to be entering treatment at follow-up (95% CI: 2.08-4.17, P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 6-month buprenorphine implants are noninferior to daily sublingual buprenorphine as maintenance treatment for opioid-dependent patients with stable abstinence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient, randomized, active-controlled, 24-week, double-blind, double-dummy study conducted at 21 US sites from June 26, 2014, through May 18, 2015. Outpatients were prescribed daily sublingual buprenorphine for 6 months or more, were abstinent while taking 8 mg/d or less of sublingual buprenorphine for 90 days or longer, and were determined to be clinically stable by their physician. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive sublingual buprenorphine plus 4 placebo implants or sublingual placebo plus four 80-mg buprenorphine hydrochloride implants (expected efficacy, 24 weeks). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary end point was between-group difference in proportion of responders (≥4 of 6 months without opioid-positive urine test result [monthly and 4 times randomly] and self-report). The noninferiority established for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was greater than -0.20 (P < .025). Secondary end points included cumulative percentage of negative opioid urine results, abstinence, and time to first illicit opioid use. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting. RESULTS: Of 177 participants (mean age, 39 years; 40.9% female), 90 were randomized to sublingual buprenorphine with placebo implants and 87 to buprenorphine implants with sublingual placebo; 165 of 177 (93.2%) completed the trial. Eighty-one of 84 (96.4%) receiving buprenorphine implants and 78 of 89 (87.6%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine were responders, an 8.8% difference (1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.009 to ∞; P < .001 for noninferiority). Over 6 months, 72 of 84 (85.7%) receiving buprenorphine implants and 64 of 89 (71.9%) receiving sublingual buprenorphine maintained opioid abstinence (hazard ratio, 13.8; 95% CI, 0.018-0.258; P = .03). Non-implant-related and implant-related adverse events occurred in 48.3% and 23% of the buprenorphine implant group and in 52.8% and 13.5% of participants in the sublingual buprenorphine group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with opioid dependence maintaining abstinence with a stable dose of sublingual buprenorphine, the use of buprenorphine implants compared with continued sublingual buprenorphine did not result in an inferior likelihood of remaining a responder. However, the study population had an exceptionally high response rate in the control group, and further studies are needed in broader populations to assess the efficacy in other settings.

METHODS: In this cluster-randomized trial, primary care clinics in three healthcare systems were randomized to receive or not receive access to an OUD-SDM system. The OUD-SDM system alerts PCCs and patients to elevated risk of OUD and supports OUD screening and treatment. It includes guidance on OUD screening and diagnosis, treatment selection, starting and maintaining patients on buprenorphine for waivered clinicians, and screening for common comorbid conditions. The primary study outcome is, of patients at high risk for OUD, the percentage receiving an OUD diagnosis within 30 days of index visit. Additional outcomes are, of patients at high risk for or with a diagnosis of OUD, (a) the percentage receiving a naloxone prescription, or (b) the percentage receiving a medication for OUD (MOUD) prescription or referral to specialty care within 30 days of an index visit, and (c) total days covered by a MOUD prescription within 90 days of an index visit. RESULTS: The intervention started in April 2021 and continues through December 2023. PCCs and patients in 90 clinics are included; study results are expected in 2024. CONCLUSION: This protocol paper describes the design of a multi-site trial to help PCCs recognize and treat OUD. If effective, this OUD-SDM intervention could improve screening of at-risk patients and rates of OUD treatment for people with OUD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rossom RC ; Crain AL ; O'Connor PJ ; Wright E ; Haller IV ; Hooker SA ; Sperl-Hillen JM ; Olson A ; Romagnoli K ; Solberg L ; Dehmer SP ; Haapala J ; Borgert-Spaniol C ; Tusing L ; Muegge J ; Allen C ; Ekstrom H ; Huntley K ; McCormack J ; Bart G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2022.107012 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nPrimary Health Care\r\nOpioid overdose\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nPragmatic clinical trial\r\nPrimary care\r\nShared decision-making","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rossom RC, Crain AL, O'Connor PJ, Wright E, Haller IV, Hooker SA, Sperl-Hillen JM, Olson A, Romagnoli K, Solberg L, Dehmer SP, Haapala J, Borgert-Spaniol C, Tusing L, Muegge J, Allen C, Ekstrom H, Huntley K, McCormack J, and Bart G (2023) Design of a pragmatic clinical trial to improve screening and treatment for opioid use disorder in primary care..

We conducted a systematic review of studies on the prevalence of non-prescribed methadone use, methadone use disorder, and methadone-related poisoning and mortality in Iran. Methods: We searched International and Iranian databases up to May 2020 and contacted relevant experts. The pooled proportions were estimated through random-effects model. Methadone-related adverse outcomes were evaluated over time. Results: Sixty-five studies were included. The pooled estimates of non-prescribed methadone use in the last 12-month were 2.7% (95%CI: 0.9–5.4) and 0.1% (95%CI: 0.03–0.2) in the male and female general population, respectively. Among people who use drugs, 8.4% reported daily non-prescribed use in 2018. Four heterogeneous studies in drug treatment centers reported the existence of treatment-seeking for methadone use disorder. Methadone was responsible for 10.4% (95%CI: 4.5–18.3) of cases of acute poisoning in adults and 16.0% (95%CI: 9.3–24.1) in children. Methadone was reported as a cause of death in 53.5% of substance-related deaths referred to the Legal Medicine Organization while being the only cause in 35.8% of all cases. Conclusion: Non-prescribed use of methadone in the general population is much less than opiates and some other available prescription opioids, like tramadol. However, notwithstanding the large and successful MMT program in Iran, increasing trends in methadone-related poisoning and deaths pose serious public health concerns. There is an urgent need to explore these fatal and non-fatal poisoning cases and implement policies to curb the harms associated with methadone use.","Comments":"2022-03-25","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rostam-Abadi Y ; Gholami J ; Noroozi A ; Ansari M ; Baheshmat S ; Hamzehzadeh M ; Ghadirzadeh M R; Vahdani B ; Ekhtiari H ; Mojtabai R ; Rahimi-Movaghar A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103529","Keywords":"methadone\r\nage distribution\r\ncause of death\r\nchronic pain\r\nconfidence interval\r\ndata base\r\ndata extraction\r\ndetoxification\r\ndrug dependence\r\ngender\r\nhealth hazard\r\nhelp seeking behavior\r\nhigh risk population\r\nhuman\r\nintoxication\r\nIran\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone poisoning\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmethadone use disorder\r\nopiate addiction\r\npopulation research\r\nprescription\r\nprevalence\r\npublic health\r\nquality control\r\nreview\r\nstatistical analysis\r\nsystematic review\r\ntrend study\r\nuniversity student","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rostam-Abadi Y, Gholami J, Noroozi A, Ansari M, Baheshmat S, Hamzehzadeh M, Ghadirzadeh M R, Vahdani B, Ekhtiari H, Mojtabai R, and Rahimi-Movaghar A (2022) Public health risks associated with methadone in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

To date, patients willing to start methadone can only do so in a methadone clinic (a medical centre for drug and alcohol dependence (CSAPA) or a hospital setting) and are referred to primary care physicians after dose stabilization. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of methadone in patients who initiated treatment in primary care compared with those who initiated it in a CSAPA, by measuring abstinence from street opioid use after one year of treatment. METHODS/DESIGN: The ANRS-Methaville study is a randomized multicenter non-inferiority control trial comparing methadone induction (lasting approximately 2 weeks) in primary care and in CSAPA. The model of care chosen for methadone induction in primary care was based on study-specific pre-training of all physicians, exclusion criteria and daily supervision of methadone during the initiation phase. Between January 2009 and January 2011, 10 sites each having one CSAPA and several primary care physicians, were identified to recruit patients to be randomized into two groups, one starting methadone in primary care (n = 147), the other in CSAPA (n = 48). The primary outcome of the study is the proportion of participants abstinent from street opioids after 1 year of treatment i.e. non-inferiority of primary care model in terms of the proportion of patients not using street opioids compared with the proportion observed in those starting methadone in a CSAPA. DISCUSSION: The ANRS-Methaville study is the first in France to use an interventional trial to improve access to OMT for drug users. Once the non-inferiority results become available, the Ministry of Health and agency for the safety of health products may change the the New Drug Application (NDA) of methadone and make methadone induction by trained primary care physicians possible.The trial is registered with the French Agency of Pharmaceutical Products (AFSSAPS) under the number 2008-A0277-48, the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials.Number Eudract 2008-001338-28, the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00657397 and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register ISRCTN31125511.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Roux P ; Michel L ; Cohen J ; Mora M ; Morel A ; Aubertin JF ; Desenclos JC ; Spire B ; Carrieri PM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2458-12-488 ","Keywords":"Follow-Up Studies\r\nFrance\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPrimary Health Care/*organization & administration\r\nSubstance Abuse Treatment Centers\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Roux P, Michel L, Cohen J, Mora M, Morel A, Aubertin JF, Desenclos JC, Spire B, and Carrieri PM (2012) Methadone induction in primary care (ANRS-Methaville): a phase III randomized intervention trial..

Canadian OAT guidelines outline take-home dose (THD) criteria, yet, OAT prescribers use their clinical judgement to decide whether an individual is ‘clinically stable’ to receive THD. There is limited information regarding whether these decisions may result in inequitable access to THD, including in the context of updated COVID-19 guidance. The current Canadian OAT THD guideline synthesis and systematic review aimed to address this knowledge gap. Methods: This systematic review included a two-pronged approach. First, we searched available academic literature in Embase, Medline, and PsychINFO up until October 12th, 2022, to identify studies that compared characteristics of individuals on OAT who had and had not been granted access to THD to explore potential inequities in access. Next, we identified all Canadian national and provincial OAT guidelines through a semi-structured grey literature search (conducted between September-October 2022) and extracted all THD ‘stability’ and allowances/timeline criteria to compare against characteristics identified in the literature search. Data from both review arms were synthesized and narratively presented. Results: A total of n = 56 guidelines and n = 7 academic studies were included. The systematic review identified a number of patient characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, housing, employment, neighborhood income, drug use, mental health, health service utilization, as well as treatment duration that were associated with differential access to THD. The Canadian OAT THD guideline synthesis identified many of these same characteristics as ‘stability’ criteria, underscoring the potential for Canadian OAT guidelines to result in inequitable access to THD. Conclusions: This two-pronged literature review demonstrated that current guidelines likely contribute to inequitable OAT THD access due primarily to inconsistent ‘stability’ criteria across guidelines. More research is needed to understand differential OAT THD access with a focus on prescriber decision-making and evaluating associated treatment and safety outcomes. The development of a client-centered, equity-focused, and evidence-informed decision making framework that incorporates more clear definitions of ‘stability’ criteria and indications for prescriber discretion is warranted.","Comments":"2024-04-09","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Russell C ; Ashley J ; Ali F ; Bozinoff N ; Corace K ; Marsh D C; Mushquash C ; Wyman J ; Zhang M ; Lange S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugpo.2024.104343","Keywords":"buprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nmethadone\r\nopiate\r\nopiate agonist\r\naccess to medication\r\nage\r\nclinical feature\r\ncoronavirus disease 2019\r\ndisease association\r\nemployment\r\nethnicity\r\ngender\r\nhealth care utilization\r\nhome care\r\nhousing\r\nhuman\r\nincome\r\nisolation\r\nmarriage\r\nmedical decision making\r\nmedication compliance\r\nneighborhood\r\nopiate addiction\r\npractice guideline\r\npsychosis\r\nreview\r\nsleep quality\r\nsocial distancing\r\nsuicidal ideation\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Russell C, Ashley J, Ali F, Bozinoff N, Corace K, Marsh D C, Mushquash C, Wyman J, Zhang M, and Lange S (2024) Examining inequities in access to opioid agonist treatment (OAT) take-home doses (THD): A Canadian OAT guideline synthesis and systematic review.

We evaluated the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability experience of monthly extended-release buprenorphine (BUP-XR) in participants seeking treatment for OUD, via integrated analysis of phase 3 studies. METHODS: Study 1 was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of participants receiving monthly injections of BUP-XR (300 mg × 2, 100 mg × 4 [n = 203] or 300 mg × 6 [n = 201]) or placebo (n = 100). Study 2 was a 48-week, open-label trial enrolling 257 participants who completed study 1 and 412 de novo participants, to receive 6 and 12 BUP-XR injections, respectively. Study 3 was a 24-week, open-label extension enrolling 208 participants who completed study 2 for 6 additional injections. We assessed opioid abstinence as the proportion of urine opioid negative participants by visit and the percentage of each participant's negative opioid assessments during the first 6 months. RESULTS: In total, 916 participants were treated with BUP-XR or placebo. By the end of 18 months, 92.7 % of the de novo cohort and 81.8 % of the study 1 cohort were urine negative for opioids. Among early nonresponders (percentage of abstinence ≤20 %), 73.1 % were urine negative after 18 months. The longer treatment period was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns, and a low incidence of opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms, and hepatic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Extending BUP-XR treatment beyond 6 months sustained improvement in opioid abstinence and was well tolerated, supporting clinical benefit up to 18 months.

Patients with opioid use disorder are over-represented in ED presentations. Opioid agonist treatment is the most effective community-based treatment. Buprenorphine is considered the safest of these treatments to use in the ED setting. This rapid review investigated the effectiveness of initiating buprenorphine in the ED setting. Medline, Embase, Emcare, PSYCinfo, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched. Randomised and non-randomised studies published in peer-reviewed journals that involved the initiation of buprenorphine in the ED setting were considered eligible. The search revealed 350 articles of which 11 were included in the review; three articles representing two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies. Data were extracted from included papers and risk of bias assessed on the RCTs. One well-conducted RCT showed that buprenorphine initiated in the ED does improve treatment engagement up to 2 months after an ED visit. Eight observational studies, one with a comparator group reported positive results for this intervention. There is strong evidence that clinicians should consider commencing buprenorphine in the ED for patients with opioid use disorder when combined with a direct and supported referral or 'warm handover' to community care. Further implementation studies and investigation of long-acting injectable buprenorphine treatment are required.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Salter H ; Hutton J ; Cantwell K ; Dietze P ; Higgs P ; Straub A ; Zordan R ; Lloyd-Jones M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/1742-6723.13654 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nEmergency Service, Hospital\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nemergency\r\nopioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Salter H, Hutton J, Cantwell K, Dietze P, Higgs P, Straub A, Zordan R, and Lloyd-Jones M (2020) Review article: Rapid review of the emergency department-initiated buprenorphine for opioid use disorder..

This change has caused a shift in the demographic profile of OUD patients from predominantly young men to middle age and older people. The management of OUD includes medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which produces varying rates of treatment response. In this study, we will examine whether the source of first opioid use has an effect on treatment outcomes in OUD. Using a systematic review of the literature, we will investigate the association between source of first opioid introduction and treatment outcomes defined as continuing illicit opioid use and poly-substance use while in MAT. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINHAL, and PsycInfo were searched from inception to December 31(st), 2019 inclusive using a comprehensive search strategy. Five pairs of reviewers conducted screening and data extraction independently in duplicate. The review is conducted and reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. A random-effects model was used for meta analyses assuming heterogeneity among the included studies. RESULTS: The initial search results in 27,345 articles that were screened, and five observational studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Our results found that those who were introduced to opioids through a legitimate prescription were significantly less likely to have illicit opioid use (0.70, 95% CI 0.50, 0.99) while on MAT. They were also less likely to use cannabis (0.54, 95% CI 0.32, 0.89), alcohol (0.75, 95% CI 0.59, 0.95), cocaine (0.50, 95% CI 0.29, 0.85), and injection drug use (0.25, 95% CI 0.14, 0.43) than those introduced to opioids through recreational means. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the first exposure to opioids, whether through a prescription or recreationally, influences prognosis and treatment outcomes of opioid use disorder. Although the increased pattern of prescribing opioids may have led to increased OUD in a new cohort of patients, these patients are less likely to continue to use illicit drugs and have a different prognostic and clinical profile that requires a tailored approach to treatment.

Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is an effective treatment for opioid dependence; however, there has not yet been a systematic review on the relationship between OAT and specific causes of mortality. Objective: To estimate the association of time receiving OAT with mortality. Data Sources: The Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases were searched through February 18, 2020, including clinical trial registries and previous Cochrane reviews. Study Selection: All observational studies that collected data on all-cause or cause-specific mortality among people with opioid dependence while receiving and not receiving OAT were included. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were also included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data on study, participant, and treatment characteristics were extracted; person-years, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality were calculated. Crude mortality rates and rate ratios (RRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall all-cause and cause-specific mortality both by setting and by participant characteristics. Methadone and buprenorphine OAT were evaluated specifically. Results: Fifteen RCTs including 3852 participants and 36 primary cohort studies including 749634 participants were analyzed. Among the cohort studies, the rate of all-cause mortality during OAT was more than half of the rate seen during time out of OAT (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.42-0.53). This association was consistent regardless of patient sex, age, geographic location, HIV status, and hepatitis C virus status and whether drugs were taken through injection. Associations were not different for methadone (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.41-0.54) vs buprenorphine (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.26-0.45). There was lower risk of suicide (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.37-0.61), cancer (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-0.98), drug-related (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.33-0.52), alcohol-related (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49-0.72), and cardiovascular-related (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60-0.79) mortality during OAT. In the first 4 weeks of methadone treatment, rates of all-cause mortality and drug-related poisoning were almost double the rates during the remainder of OAT (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.55-5.09) but not for buprenorphine (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.18-1.85). All-cause mortality was 6 times higher in the 4 weeks after OAT cessation (RR, 6.01; 95% CI, 4.32-8.36), remaining double the rate for the remainder of time not receiving OAT (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.50-2.18). Opioid agonist treatment was associated with a lower risk of mortality during incarceration (RR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.46) and after release from incarceration (RR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.56). Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that OAT was associated with lower rates of mortality. However, access to OAT remains limited, and coverage of OAT remains low. Work to improve access globally may have important population-level benefits.","Comments":"2023-10-04","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Santo T ; Clark B ; Hickman M ; Grebely J ; Campbell G ; Sordo L ; Chen A ; Tran L T; Bharat C ; Padmanathan P ; Cousins G ; Dupouy J ; Kelty E ; Muga R ; Nosyk B ; Min J ; Pavarin R ; Farrell M ; Degenhardt L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0976","Keywords":"alcohol\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nopiate agonist\r\nadult\r\nall cause mortality\r\ncancer risk\r\ncardiovascular mortality\r\ncause of death\r\ndrug intoxication\r\nfemale\r\nhepatitis virus\r\nhuman\r\nincarceration\r\ninjury\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nmortality rate\r\nmortality risk\r\nopiate addiction\r\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsuicide\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Santo T, Clark B, Hickman M, Grebely J, Campbell G, Sordo L, Chen A, Tran L T, Bharat C, Padmanathan P, Cousins G, Dupouy J, Kelty E, Muga R, Nosyk B, Min J, Pavarin R, Farrell M, and Degenhardt L (2021) Association of Opioid Agonist Treatment with All-Cause Mortality and Specific Causes of Death among People with Opioid Dependence: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

International guidelines recommend opioid substitution treatment (OST), such as methadone and buprenorphine, as first-line medication treatment for OD. A negative aspect of OST is that the medication used can be diverted both through sale on the black market, and the unsanctioned use of medications. Daily supervised administration of medications used in OST has the advantage of reducing the risk of diversion, and may promote therapeutic engagement, potentially enhancing the psychosocial aspect of OST, but costs more and is more restrictive on the client than dispensing for off-site consumption. Objectives: The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of OST with supervised dosing relative to dispensing of medication for off-site consumption. Search methods: We searched in Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science from inception up to April 2016. Ongoing and unpublished studies were searched via ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/). All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references on topic-related systematic reviews. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and prospective controlled cohort studies, involving people who are receiving OST (methadone, buprenorphine) and comparing supervised dosing with dispensing of medication to be consumed away from the dispensing point, usually without supervision. Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Main results: Six studies (four RCTs and two prospective observational cohort studies), involving 7999 participants comparing supervised OST treatment with unsupervised treatment, met the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was generally moderate across trials, but the results reported on outcomes that we planned to consider were limited. Overall, we judged the quality of the evidence from very low to low for all the outcomes. We found no difference in retention at any duration with supervised compared to unsupervised dosing (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12, 716 participants, four trials, low-quality evidence) or in retention in the shortest follow-up period, three months (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.05; 472 participants, three trials, low-quality evidence). Additional data at 12 months from one observational study found no difference in retention between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.14; n = 300).There was no difference in abstinence at the end of treatment (self-reported drug use) (67% versus 60%, P = 0.33, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence); and in diversion of medication (5% versus 2%, 293 participants, one trial, very low-quality evidence). Regarding our secondary outcomes, we did not found a difference in the incidence of adverse effects in the supervised compared to unsupervised control group (RR 0.63; 96% CI 0.10 to 3.86; 363 participants, two trials, very low-quality evidence). Data on severity of dependence were very limited (244 participants, one trial) and showed no difference between the two approaches. Data on deaths were reported in two studies. One trial reported two deaths in the supervised group (low-quality evidence), while in the cohort study all-cause mortality was found lower in regular supervision group (crude mortality rate 0.60 versus 0.81 per 100 person-years), although after adjustment insufficient evidence existed to suggest that regular supervision was protective (mortality rate ratio = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.27). No studies reported pain symptoms, drug craving, aberrant opioid-related behaviours, days of unsanctioned opioid use and overdose. Authors' conclusions: Take-home medication strategies are attractive to treatment services due to lower costs, and place less restrictions on clients, but it is unknown whether they may be associated with increased risk of diversion and unsanctioned use of medication. There is uncertainty about the effects of supervised dosing compared with unsupervised medication due to the low and very low quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for this review. Data on defined secondary outcomes were similarly limited. More research comparing supervised and take-home medication strategies is needed to support decisions on the relative effectiveness of these strategies. The trials should be designed and conducted with high quality and over a longer follow-up period to support comparison of strategies at different stages of treatment. In particular, there is a need for studies assessing in more detail the risk of diversion and safety outcomes of using supervised OST to manage opioid dependence.","Comments":"2017-05-09","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saulle R ; Vecchi S ; Gowing L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD011983.pub2","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nlong acting drug\r\nmethadone\r\nnarcotic analgesic agent\r\nclinical effectiveness\r\nclinical supervision\r\ndrug craving\r\nhuman\r\nmotivation\r\nopiate addiction\r\nopiate substitution treatment\r\nprescription drug diversion\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saulle R, Vecchi S, and Gowing L (2017) Supervised dosing with a long-acting opioid medication in the management of opioid dependence.

This study evaluated the impact of MAT and psychosocial therapies on treatment outcomes for patients with co-occurring opioid use disorders and PTSD. METHODS: Patients meeting criteria for PTSD and substance use disorders were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: Standard Care (SC) alone, Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) plus SC, or Individual Addiction Counseling (IAC) plus SC. Substance use and psychiatric symptoms were assessed at baseline and 6 months. Only patients with opioid use disorders were included in the present analyses (n = 126). Two-way ANOVAS and logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between treatment conditions and MAT, for substance use and psychiatric outcomes. RESULTS: MAT patients receiving ICBT had significantly decreased odds of a positive urine drug screen, compared to non-MAT patients receiving SC alone (OR = .07, 95% CI = .01, .81, p = .03). For PTSD symptoms, a significant MAT by psychosocial treatment condition interaction demonstrated that MAT patients had comparable declines in PTSD symptoms regardless of psychosocial treatment type (F(2, 88) = 4.74, p = .011). Non-MAT patients in ICBT had significantly larger reductions in PTSD. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: For patients with co-occurring opioid use disorders and PTSD, MAT plus ICBT is associated with more significant improvement in substance use. For non-MAT patients, ICBT is most beneficial for PTSD symptoms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saunders EC ; McGovern MP ; Lambert-Harris C ; Meier A ; McLeman B ; Xie H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/ajad.12292 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Cognitive Behavioral Therapy\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nCounseling\r\nDiagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use\r\nStress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/complications/*drug therapy/*therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nco-occurring disorders\r\nintegrated treatment\r\nmedication-assisted treatment\r\nopioid dependence\r\nposttraumatic stress disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saunders EC, McGovern MP, Lambert-Harris C, Meier A, McLeman B, and Xie H (2015) The impact of addiction medications on treatment outcomes for persons with co-occurring PTSD and opioid use disorders..

This may lead to opioid use disorder (OUD) and psychiatric symptoms: mainly depression and anxiety. The current study investigated the effect of buprenorphine/naloxone (BuNa) rotation on opioid misuse, craving, psychiatric symptoms and pain in patients with CNCP and OUD. Forty-three participants with CNCP and OUD were converted from a full mu-receptor agonist opioid (mean morphine equivalent dose: 328.3 mg) to BuNa, in an inpatient setting. Opioid misuse, craving, co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, and pain perception were determined at baseline and after a two-month follow-up, using the following self-report questionnaires: Current Opioid Misuse Measurement (COMM), Visual Analog Scale (VAS-craving and VAS-pain) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), respectively. VAS-craving and VAS-pain were also determined immediately after conversion. A total of 37 participants completed the protocol. The mean COMM decreased from 17.1 to 6.7 (F = 36.5; p < 0.000), the mean VAS-craving decreased from 39.3 to 5.3 (−86.6%; F = 26.5, p < 0.000), the mean DASS decreased from 12.1 to 6.6 (F = 56.3, p < 0.000), and the mean VAS-pain decreased from 51.3 to 37.2 (−27.4%, F = 3.3; p = 0.043). Rotation to BuNa in patients with CNCP and OUD was accompanied by reductions in (i) opioid misuse, (ii) opioid craving, (iii) the severity of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, and (iv) self-reported pain. BuNa as opioid agonist treatment may therefore be a beneficial strategy in CNCP patients with OUD. The limited sample size and the observational nature of this study underline the need for the replication of the current findings in large-scale, controlled studies.","Comments":"2021-10-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schellekens A F.A; Veldman S E; Suranto E S.D; van Rijswijk S M; van der Wal S E.I; Schene A H; van Beek M H.C.T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/jcm10163727","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nclonidine\r\nfentanyl\r\nloperamide\r\nmethadone\r\nmetoclopramide\r\nmu opiate receptor agonist\r\nnonsteroid antiinflammatory agent\r\nopiate\r\noxycodone\r\nparacetamol\r\npregabalin\r\nadd on therapy\r\nadult\r\naged\r\narticle\r\ncancer pain\r\nchronic pain\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scale\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nDSM-5\r\nDSM-IV-TR\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nmental health\r\nmini international neuropsychiatric interview\r\nnociception\r\nnumeric rating scale\r\nobservational study\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain assessment\r\npain severity\r\nprospective study\r\npsychometry\r\nquestionnaire\r\nself report\r\nvisual analog scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schellekens A F.A, Veldman S E, Suranto E S.D, van Rijswijk S M, van der Wal S E.I, Schene A H, and van Beek M H.C.T (2021) Beneficial effects of opioid rotation to buprenorphine/naloxone on opioid misuse, craving, mental health, and pain control in chronic non-cancer pain patients with opioid use disorder.

One challenge is that many persons who present for MMT also have co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Individually, both methadone and psychiatric medications carry risk of weight gain. Therefore, concurrent prescribing of methadone and psychiatric medications places dual diagnosis patients at even greater risk. As a parallel obesity epidemic grows, results from clinical trials assessing weight gain and weight management strategies among MMT and psychiatric patients can both inform and guide clinical practice. This study reviews findings from a literature search for recent clinical trials that focused on weight gain and weight management strategies during MMT with concurrent psychotropic medication use. While several studies have documented weight gain during MMT and psychotropic medication treatment, this study failed to identify recent work that explored concurrent prescribing. Most weight management strategies involved the use of additional medications and available data suggests that MMT and concurrent use of psychotropic medications increases the risk for obesity. More robust research is needed on weight gain and potential mitigation strategies when these treatment modalities are jointly utilized. Clarification of underlying biological mechanisms and development of non-pharmacological interventions merit further consideration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schlienz NJ ; Huhn AS ; Speed TJ ; Sweeney MM ; Antoine DG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/09540261.2018.1509843 ","Keywords":"Body Weight Maintenance/*drug effects\r\n*Diagnosis, Dual (Psychiatry)\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*adverse effects\r\nNarcotics/*adverse effects\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPsychotropic Drugs/*adverse effects\r\nWeight Gain/*drug effects\r\nOpioids\r\ndual diagnosis\r\nmethadone\r\nobesity\r\nweight gain","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schlienz NJ, Huhn AS, Speed TJ, Sweeney MM, and Antoine DG (2018) Double jeopardy: a review of weight gain and weight management strategies for psychotropic medication prescribing during methadone maintenance treatment..

Video DOT technologies may safeguard against this issue and thus enhance likelihood of treatment success. We describe the rationale and protocol for the Trial of Adherence Application for Buprenorphine treatment (TAAB) study, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effects of video DOT delivered via a smartphone app on office-based buprenorphine treatment outcomes, namely illicit opioid use and retention. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from office-based opioid addiction treatment programs in outpatient clinics at two urban medical centers and randomized to either video DOT (intervention) delivered via a HIPAA-compliant, asynchronous, mobile health (mHealth) technology platform, or treatment-as-usual (control). Eligibility criteria are: 18 years or older, prescribed sublingual buprenorphine for a cumulative total of 28 days or less from the office-based opioid treatment program, and able to read and understand English. Patients will be considered ineligible if they are unable or unwilling to use the intervention, provide consent, or complete weekly study visits. All participants will complete 13 in-person weekly visits and be followed via electronic health record data capture at 12- and 24-weeks post-randomization. Data gathered include the following: demographics; current and previous treatment for OUD; self-reported diversion of prescribed buprenorphine; status of their mental and physical health; and self-reported lifetime and past 30-day illicit substance use. Participants provide urine samples at each weekly visit to test for illicit drugs and buprenorphine. The primary outcome is percentage of weekly urines that are negative for opioids over the 12-weeks. The secondary outcome is engagement in treatment at week 12. DISCUSSION: Video DOT delivered through mHealth technology platform offers possibility of improving patients' buprenorphine adherence by providing additional structure and accountability. The TAAB study will provide important preliminary estimates of the impact of this mHealth technology for patients initiating buprenorphine, as well as the feasibility of study procedures, thus paving the way for further research to assess feasibility and generate preliminary data for design of a future Phase III trial.

It was hypothesized that IM participants would have a: (1) lower number of arrests at 6 and 12 months and (2) lower mean crime severity scores at 6 and 12 months post-baseline. METHODS: Available official arrest data were obtained for all 319 study participants for a period of 2 years before and after study enrollment. Crime severity ratings of charges were made using an established measure of crime severity. FINDINGS: Participants randomly assigned to IM as compared to those on a waiting list had a significant reduction in number of arrests at 6 but not at 12 months from study enrollment. There were no significant differences in whether participants were arrested for a more severe crime but frequency of severe crime was relatively low in both groups. Additional post hoc analyses based on whether participants were in methadone treatment at 4 and 10 months after original random assignment to treatment condition revealed that those participants not in treatment at these follow-up assessment points were significantly more likely to be arrested and to have a higher mean crime severity rating at 12 and 24 months post-baseline assessment. CONCLUSIONS: IM as compared to the waiting list condition, had a significant reduction in number of officially recorded arrests from baseline to 6 months post-baseline. Those who were enrolled in methadone treatment at the 4- and 10-month follow-up assessment, regardless of initial assignment, had fewer arrests at 12 and 24 months post-baseline.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schwartz RP ; Jaffe JH ; O'Grady KE ; Kinlock TW ; Gordon MS ; Kelly SM ; Wilson ME ; Ahmed A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.03.007 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nCrime/*statistics & numerical data\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage\r\nTime Factors\r\nWaiting Lists","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schwartz RP, Jaffe JH, O'Grady KE, Kinlock TW, Gordon MS, Kelly SM, Wilson ME, and Ahmed A (2009) Interim methadone treatment: impact on arrests..

METHODS: This is a three-group randomized controlled trial in which 225 detainees in Baltimore treated for opioid withdrawal were assigned to: (1) interim methadone (IM) with patient navigation (IM + PN); (2) IM; or (3) enhanced treatment-as-usual (ETAU). Participants in both IM groups were able to enter standard methadone treatment upon release, while ETAU participants received an assessment/referral number. Follow-up assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-release determined treatment enrollment, urine drug testing results, self-reported days of drug use, criminal activity, and overdose events. Generalized linear mixed modelling examined two planned contrasts: (1) IM groups combined vs. ETAU; and (2) IM + PN vs. IM. RESULTS: On an intention-to-treat basis, compared to ETAU, significantly more participants in the combined IM groups were in treatment 30 days post-release, while the IM + PN vs. IM groups did not significantly differ. By month 12, there were no significant differences in the estimated marginal means of enrollment in any kind of drug treatment (0.40 and 0.27 for IM + PN and IM groups, respectively, compared to 0.29 for ETAU). There were no significant differences for either contrast in opioid-positive tests, although all groups reported a sharp decrease in heroin use from baseline to follow-up. There were five fatal overdoses, but none occurred during methadone treatment. CONCLUSION: Initiating methadone treatment in jail was effective in promoting entry into community-based drug abuse treatment but subsequent treatment discontinuation attenuated any potential impact of such treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schwartz RP ; Kelly SM ; Mitchell SG ; O'Grady KE ; Sharma A ; Jaffe JH ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2019.107680 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nBaltimore/epidemiology\r\nDrug Overdose/*epidemiology\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data\r\nPrisoners/*statistics & numerical data\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nCriminal justice\r\nInterim methadone treatment\r\nJail\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nOverdose death\r\nPatient navigation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schwartz RP, Kelly SM, Mitchell SG, O'Grady KE, Sharma A, and Jaffe JH (2020) Methadone treatment of arrestees: A randomized clinical trial..

Infectious Disease (ID) specialists manage severe infections that require hospitalization and are a logical resource to engage patients in medication treatment for OUD (MOUD). An injectable long-acting monthly formulation of buprenorphine (LAB) has a potential advantage for initiating MOUD within hospital settings and bridging to treatment after discharge. METHODS: A randomized multi-site trial tests a new model of care (ID/LAB) in which OUD and infections are managed by ID specialists and hospitalists using LAB coupled with referrals to community resources for long-term MOUD. A sample of 200 adults admitted to three U.S. hospitals for OUD and infections are randomly assigned 1:1 to ID/LAB or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients enrolled in effective MOUD at 12 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes include relapse to opioid use, adherence to infectious disease treatment, infection morbidity and mortality, and drug overdose. RESULTS: We describe the design, procedures, statistical analysis, and early implementation issues of this randomized trial. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings will provide insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of integrated treatment of OUD and serious infections and have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Seval N ; Frank CA ; Litwin AH ; Roth P ; Schade MA ; Pavlicova M ; Levin FR ; Brady KT ; Nunes EV ; Springer SA ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2021.106394 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\n*Delivery of Health Care, Integrated\r\nHumans\r\nNeoplasm Recurrence, Local\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nHospital\r\nInfectious disease\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nRandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Seval N, Frank CA, Litwin AH, Roth P, Schade MA, Pavlicova M, Levin FR, Brady KT, Nunes EV, and Springer SA (2021) Design and methods of a multi-site randomized controlled trial of an integrated care model of long-acting injectable buprenorphine with infectious disease treatment among persons hospitalized with infections and opioid use disorder..

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial of 552 patients from 34 clusters (drug treatment clinics) randomly allocated 1:1:1 to opioid agonist treatment plus weekly keyworker appointments with (1) CM targeted at heroin abstinence (CM abstinence), (2) CM targeted at on-time attendance at weekly appointments (CM attendance), or (3) no CM (TAU). The primary cost-effectiveness analysis at 24 weeks after randomization took a societal cost perspective with effects measured in heroin-negative urine samples. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, mean differences in weekly heroin-negative urine results compared with TAU were 0.252 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.397 to 0.901) for CM abstinence and 0.089 (95% CI -0.223 to 0.402) for CM attendance. Mean differences in costs were £2562 (95% CI £32-£5092) for CM abstinence and £317 (95% CI -£882 to £1518) for CM attendance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were £10 167 per additional heroin-free urine for CM abstinence and £3562 for CM attendance with low probabilities of cost-effectiveness of 3.5% and 36%, respectively. Results were sensitive to timing of follow-up for CM attendance, which dominated TAU (better outcomes, lower costs) at 12 weeks, with an 88.4% probability of being cost-effective. Probability of cost-effectiveness remained low for CM abstinence (8.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives targeted toward heroin abstinence and treatment attendance were not cost-effective over the 24-week follow-up. Nevertheless, CM attendance was cost-effective over the treatment period (12 weeks), when participants were receiving keyworker appointments and incentives.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shearer J ; Metrebian N ; Weaver T ; Goldsmith K ; Strang J ; Pilling S ; Mitcheson L ; Day E ; Dunn J ; Glasper A ; Akhtar S ; Bajaria J ; Charles V ; Desai R ; Haque F ; Little N ; McKechnie H ; Mosler F ; Mutz J ; Poovendran D ; Byford S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jval.2022.11.021 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Heroin/therapeutic use\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nMotivation\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Heroin Dependence\r\ncluster randomized trial\r\ncontingency management\r\ncost-effectiveness analysis\r\nopioid agonist treatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shearer J, Metrebian N, Weaver T, Goldsmith K, Strang J, Pilling S, Mitcheson L, Day E, Dunn J, Glasper A, Akhtar S, Bajaria J, Charles V, Desai R, Haque F, Little N, McKechnie H, Mosler F, Mutz J, Poovendran D, and Byford S (2023) The Cost-Effectiveness of Financial Incentives to Achieve Heroin Abstinence in Individuals With Heroin Use Disorder Starting New Treatment Episodes: A Cluster Randomized Trial-Based Economic Evaluation..

Web-based interventions may be a novel strategy for providing evidence-based behavioral care to individuals receiving office-based buprenorphine maintenance. This report describes modification and initial pilot testing of Web-based training in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT4CBT) specifically for use with individuals in office-based buprenorphine. Methods: Twelve-week randomized pilot trial evaluating effects of CBT4CBT-Buprenophine in retaining participants and reducing drug use with respect to standard office-based buprenorphine alone was carried out. Twenty individuals meeting DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition) criteria for current opioid use disorder were randomized to standard buprenorphine treatment or buprenorphine plus access to CBT4CBT-Buprenorphine. Results: There were promising findings regarding rates of urine toxicology screens negative for opioids (91% versus 64%; P = .05, effect size d = 0.88) and all drugs (82% versus 30%; P = .004, d = 1.2). Individuals randomized to CBT4CBT-Buprenorphine completed a mean of 82.6 (SD = 4.4) days of treatment (of a possible 84) compared with 68.6 (SD = 32.6) for those assigned to standard buprenorphine treatment. Conclusions: Although preliminary and limited by the small sample size, this trial suggests the feasibility and promise of validated, Web-based interventions, tailored for this specific patient population, for improving outcomes in office-based buprenorphine.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shi JM ; Henry SP ; Dwy SL ; Orazietti SA ; Carroll KM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/08897077.2019.1569192 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmbulatory Care\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/*methods\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\n*Internet-Based Intervention\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*therapy\r\nPilot Projects\r\n*Retention in Care\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBehavioral interventions\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nweb-based interventions","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shi JM, Henry SP, Dwy SL, Orazietti SA, and Carroll KM (2019) Randomized pilot trial of Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapy adapted for use in office-based buprenorphine maintenance..

We investigated the association between medication treatments for OUD and pain in a post-hoc secondary analysis of a randomized trial of methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone. METHODS: 1241 individuals with OUD participated in an open label, pragmatic randomized trial of methadone versus buprenorphine/naloxone in nine treatment programs licensed to dispense agonist medication for OUD between 2006 to 2009. In this post-hoc analysis, pain was dichotomized (present or not present) using responses from the Short Form-36. Logistic regression models were fit to test the effect of (1) having baseline pain on week 24 retention, (2) treatment assignment on improvement in pain among those reporting pain at baseline, and (3) pain improvement at week 4 on week 24 retention among those reporting pain at baseline. RESULTS: Almost half (48.2%) of the sample reported pain at baseline. Participants with baseline pain did not significantly differ in week 24 retention compared to those without baseline pain. Among those reporting pain at baseline, there was no significant difference between treatment arms in improvement of pain at week 4, but improvement in pain at week 4 was associated with significantly greater odds of being retained at week 24 (OR [95% CI] = 1.76 [1.10, 2.82], P = 0.020). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this large multisite randomized trial of medication treatments for OUD, nearly half of the participants reported pain at baseline, and improvement in pain early in treatment was associated with increased likelihood of retention in treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shulman M ; Luo SX ; Campbell ANC ; Scodes J ; Pavlicova M ; Broffman A ; Saxon AJ ; Nunes EV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000630 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPain/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shulman M, Luo SX, Campbell ANC, Scodes J, Pavlicova M, Broffman A, Saxon AJ, and Nunes EV (2020) Secondary Analysis of Pain Outcomes in a Large Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Buprenorphine/Naloxone Versus Methadone for Opioid Use Disorder..

However, one of the barriers to initiating XR-naltrexone is the recommendation for a 7–10-day period of abstinence from opioids prior to the first dose. Objectives: The current study evaluated the feasibility of an XR-naltrexone induction protocol that can be implemented over 1 week in the outpatient clinic. Methods: Participants (N = 44) were seen in the clinic daily. On Day 1, after abstaining from opioids for at least 12 h, they received buprenorphine 6–8 mg. Adjunctive medications (clonidine, clonazepam, zolpidem, trazodone, and prochlorperazine) were dispensed on Days 2–5, while ascending oral doses of naltrexone were given on Days 3–5 starting with 1 mg dose. An injection of XR-naltrexone was given on Day 5, 1 h after receiving and tolerating naltrexone 24 mg. Results: Of the 44 participants (38 males), 35 (80%) were heroin users and 9 (20%) used prescription opioids. A total of 26 participants (59%) completed the induction and received their first injection of XR-naltrexone. XR-naltrexone was initiated in 54% (19/35) of heroin users and 78% (7/9) of prescription opioid users. Conclusion: The results support the feasibility of a week-long outpatient induction onto XR-naltrexone with ascending doses of naltrexone and standing doses of adjunctive medications. By circumventing the need for a protracted period of abstinence and mitigating the severity of withdrawal symptoms experienced during naltrexone titration, this strategy has the potential to increase patient acceptability and access to relapse prevention treatment with XR-naltrexone.","Comments":"2019-12-31","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sibai M ; Mishlen K ; Nunes E V; Levin F R; Mariani J J; Bisaga A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2019.1700265","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nclonazepam\r\nclonidine\r\ndiamorphine\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nprochlorperazine\r\ntrazodone\r\nzolpidem\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical outcome\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug tolerability\r\nfeasibility study\r\nfemale\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nopen study\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutpatient care\r\noutpatient department\r\nwithdrawal syndrome\r\nvivitrol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sibai M, Mishlen K, Nunes E V, Levin F R, Mariani J J, and Bisaga A (2020) A week-long outpatient induction onto XR-naltrexone in patients with opioid use disorder.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, following brief stabilization with a combination of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate, the relative efficacy of 1-, 2-, and 4-week buprenorphine tapering regimens and subsequent naltrexone hydrochloride therapy in PO-dependent outpatients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, 12-week randomized clinical trial was conducted in an outpatient research clinic. Following a brief period of buprenorphine stabilization, 70 PO-dependent adults were randomized to receive 1-, 2-, or 4-week tapers followed by naltrexone therapy. INTERVENTION: During phase 1 (weeks 1-5 after randomization), participants visited the clinic daily; during phase 2 (weeks 6-12), visits were reduced to thrice weekly. Participants received behavioral therapy and urine toxicology testing throughout the trial. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The percentage of participants negative for illicit opioid use, retention, naltrexone ingestion, and favorable treatment response (ie, retained in treatment, opioid abstinent, and receiving naltrexone at the end of the study). RESULTS: Opioid abstinence at the end of phase 1 was greater in the 4-week compared with the 2- and 1-week taper conditions (P = .02), with 63% (n = 14), 29% (n = 7), and 29% (n = 7) of participants abstinent in the 4-, 2-, and 1-week conditions, respectively. Abstinence at the end of phase 2 was also greater in the 4-week compared with the 2- and 1-week conditions (P = .03), with 50% (n = 11), 16% (n = 4), and 20% (n = 5) of participants abstinent in the 4-, 2-, and 1-week conditions, respectively. There were more treatment responders in the 4-week condition (P = .03), with 50% (n = 11), 17% (n = 4), and 21% (n = 5) of participants in the 4-, 2-, and 1-week groups considered responders at the end of treatment, respectively. Retention and naltrexone ingestion also were superior in the 4-week vs briefer tapers (both P = .04). Experimental condition (ie, taper duration) was the strongest predictor of treatment response, followed by buprenorphine stabilization dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study represents a rigorous experimental evaluation of outpatient buprenorphine stabilization, brief taper, and naltrexone maintenance for treatment of PO dependence. Results suggest that a meaningful subset of PO-dependent outpatients may respond positively to a 4-week taper plus naltrexone maintenance intervention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sigmon SC ; Dunn KE ; Saulsgiver K ; Patrick ME ; Badger GJ ; Heil SH ; Brooklyn JR ; Higgins ST ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.2216 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy/methods\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaloxone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/pharmacology\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology/urine\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sigmon SC, Dunn KE, Saulsgiver K, Patrick ME, Badger GJ, Heil SH, Brooklyn JR, and Higgins ST (2013) A randomized, double-blind evaluation of buprenorphine taper duration in primary prescription opioid abusers..

As needed doses are available to the patient, however this does not affect the overall taper length. \"Success\" of MAW was defined as appropriate urine drug screen (UDS) on admission to Labor and Delivery (LDR). Results: Among study participants (n=32) 47% had an appropriate UDS at admission to LDR. Among those who were successful vs those who were not, mean length of stay (6.20 vs. 4.18days p=0.0150) and the incidence of opiate maintenance at time of delivery (93% vs. 23%, P<.0001) were significantly different. Differences in neonatal outcomes included number of neonates treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome (33% vs. 47% p=0.4905) and mean maximum morphine dose (0.05 vs. 0.08mg p=0.3985), however none were significant. Conclusion: MAW (as performed at our institution) results in a less than 50% success rate. Success rates are higher when the taper is performed more slowly and when maintenance therapy is utilized. Therefore, if MAW is preferred by the patient, completion of the entire taper should be encouraged and maintenance therapy should be discussed following MAW completion.","Comments":"2018-06-19","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Smallwood P T; Williams C M; McQuerry K J; Critchfield A S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"methadone\r\nmorphine\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\nclinical article\r\nconference abstract\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndetoxification\r\ndrug megadose\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfemale\r\nhospital patient\r\nhuman\r\nhuman tissue\r\nincidence\r\nlength of stay\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nmedical record review\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nnewborn\r\npregnant woman\r\nretrospective study\r\nurine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smallwood P T, Williams C M, McQuerry K J, and Critchfield A S (2018) Maternal and neonatal outcomes following methadone taper for opiate detoxification.

This study was aimed at examining if availability of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) could attract individuals who for different reasons were not enrolled in an OMT program. METHODS: In a Norwegian clinical study, n = 117 opioid-dependent adults volunteered to receive XR-NTX in a 9-month period, as an extension of a previous randomized clinical trial. RESULTS: Before study inclusion, 40.2% (n = 47) of the study participants were not enrolled in OMT while the remainder were recruited from OMT. Participants not enrolled in OMT displayed more ongoing severe addiction-related problems such as heroin use (p = 0.002), but displayed a higher retention in treatment in the 9-month extension study (p = 0.048 for log-rank test) than participants enrolled in OMT. CONCLUSION: Availability of XR-NTX attracted opioid-dependent individuals not previously enrolled in OMT. While OMT may be perceived as a burden with regard to daily intake and control measures, one-monthly injections with XR-NTX may be perceived favourable, offering more freedom to the patients, not having addictive properties, and potentially reducing heroin craving. We suggest that an introduction of XR-NTX in Europe may increase the number of opioid-dependent individuals in treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Solli KK ; Kunoe N ; Latif ZE ; Sharma-Haase K ; Opheim A ; Krajci P ; Gaulen Z ; Šaltytė Benth J; Tanum L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1159/000501931 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data\r\nYoung Adult\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nMaintenance treatment program\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpioid dependency\r\nOpioid maintenance treatment\r\nTreatment of opioid dependence","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Solli KK, Kunoe N, Latif ZE, Sharma-Haase K, Opheim A, Krajci P, Gaulen Z, Šaltytė Benth J, and Tanum L (2019) Availability of Extended-Release Naltrexone May Increase the Number of Opioid-Dependent Individuals in Treatment: Extension of a Randomized Clinical Trial..

Mortality rates in and out of treatment were jointly combined across methadone or buprenorphine cohorts by using multivariate random effects meta-analysis.Results There were 19 eligible cohorts, following 122 885 people treated with methadone over 1.3-13.9 years and 15 831 people treated with buprenorphine over 1.1-4.5 years. Pooled all cause mortality rates were 11.3 and 36.1 per 1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment (unadjusted out-to-in rate ratio 3.20, 95% confidence interval 2.65 to 3.86) and reduced to 4.3 and 9.5 in and out of buprenorphine treatment (2.20, 1.34 to 3.61). In pooled trend analysis, all cause mortality dropped sharply over the first four weeks of methadone treatment and decreased gradually two weeks after leaving treatment. All cause mortality remained stable during induction and remaining time on buprenorphine treatment. Overdose mortality evolved similarly, with pooled overdose mortality rates of 2.6 and 12.7 per 1000 person years in and out of methadone treatment (unadjusted out-to-in rate ratio 4.80, 2.90 to 7.96) and 1.4 and 4.6 in and out of buprenorphine treatment.Conclusions Retention in methadone and buprenorphine treatment is associated with substantial reductions in the risk for all cause and overdose mortality in people dependent on opioids. The induction phase onto methadone treatment and the time immediately after leaving treatment with both drugs are periods of particularly increased mortality risk, which should be dealt with by both public health and clinical strategies to mitigate such risk. These findings are potentially important, but further research must be conducted to properly account for potential confounding and selection bias in comparisons of mortality risk between opioid substitution treatments, as well as throughout periods in and out of each treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sordo L ; Barrio G ; Bravo MJ ; Indave BI ; Degenhardt L ; Wiessing L ; Ferri M ; Pastor-Barriuso R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.j1550 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nDrug Overdose/*mortality\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*adverse effects/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*adverse effects\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*mortality\r\nRisk","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sordo L, Barrio G, Bravo MJ, Indave BI, Degenhardt L, Wiessing L, Ferri M, and Pastor-Barriuso R (2017) Mortality risk during and after opioid substitution treatment: systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies..

Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone are widely accepted and are used as first-line maintenance treatments for opioid dependence. Fatal intoxications with these agents, risk of diversion, and accidental intoxications, especially in children, are apparent risks and are of increasing public concern. Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet is an established treatment for opioid dependence. A novel buprenorphine/naloxone film has been developed with improved pharmacokinetics and a hopefully lower risk of diversion and accidental intoxications. AREAS COVERED: This review evaluates the available preclinical and clinical data on the novel buprenorphine/naloxone film for the treatment of opioid dependence. Literature was identified though a comprehensive PubMed search and data sources included official FDA information. EXPERT OPINION: This is an interesting new formulation of a well-established medication in opioid dependence. However, few data have been published on its safety and efficacy. In an experimental study, the new formulation suppressed symptoms of opioid withdrawal as expected. Results of an unpublished study made public by the FDA suggest a spectrum of adverse events similar to that of the conventional sublingual tablet. Some data show patients may prefer the novel film over the sublingual tablet. The estimated lower risk for diversion and especially for accidental poisoning in children cannot be assessed in clinical studies but requires data from emergency room visits.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Soyka M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1517/17425247.2012.729574 ","Keywords":"Animals\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination\r\nDrug Carriers\r\nDrug Combinations\r\nDrug Compounding\r\nHumans\r\nNaloxone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTablets","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Soyka M (2012) Buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone soluble-film for treatment of opioid dependence..

Sublingual buprenorphine has been the standard of care for treating OUD, but its use in pain management is not as clearly defined. Current practice guidelines recommend a period of mild-to-moderate withdrawal from opioids before transitioning to buprenorphine due to its ability to displace full agonists from the μ-opioid receptor. However, this strategy can lead to negative physical and psychological outcomes for patients. Novel initiation strategies suggest that concomitant administration of small doses of buprenorphine with opioids can avoid the unwanted withdrawal associated with buprenorphine initiation. We aim to systematically review the buprenorphine initiation strategies that have emerged in the last decade. Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Databases were searched for relevant literature. Studies were included if they were published in the English language and described the transition to buprenorphine from opioids. Data were collected from each study and synthesized using descriptive statistics. This review included 7 observational studies, 1 feasibility study, and 39 case reports/series which included 924 patients. The strategies utilized between the literature included traditional initiation (47.9%), microdosing with various buprenorphine formulations (16%), and miscellaneous methods (36.1%). Traditional initiation and microdosing initiation were compared in the data synthesis and analysis; miscellaneous methods were omitted given the high variability between methods. Overall, 95.6% of patients in the traditional initiation group and 96% of patients in the microdosing group successfully rotated to sublingual buprenorphine. Initiation regimens can vary widely depending on patient-specific factors and buprenorphine formulation. A variety of buprenorphine transition strategies are published in the literature, many of which were effective for patients with OUD, pain, or both.","Comments":"2022-05-30","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Spreen L A; Dittmar E N; Quirk K C; Smith M A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/phar.2676","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\ndynorphin\r\nfentanyl\r\nhydromorphone\r\nkappa opiate receptor\r\nmethadone\r\nmorphine\r\nmu opiate receptor\r\nopiate\r\noxycodone\r\nadolescent\r\nadult\r\naged\r\nagitation\r\nanalgesia\r\nanimal experiment\r\nanimal model\r\nanxiety\r\nanxiety disorder\r\narthralgia\r\nbinding affinity\r\nchronic pain\r\ncohort analysis\r\nconstipation\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndiaphoresis\r\ndiarrhea\r\ndisease severity\r\ndrug microdose\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfeasibility study\r\nfemale\r\nhuman\r\nlow back pain\r\nmajor clinical study\r\nmale\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmouse\r\nmyalgia\r\nnonhuman\r\nobservational study\r\nopiate addiction\r\npain\r\npractice guideline\r\npsychological aspect\r\nrespiration depression\r\nrestlessness\r\nreview\r\nrisk assessment\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment failure\r\ntremor\r\nvery elderly\r\nvomiting\r\nbelbuca\r\nbuprenex\r\nbuprex\r\nbutrans\r\nprefin\r\nprobuphine\r\nsublocade\r\nsuboxone\r\nsubutex\r\ntemgesic","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Spreen L A, Dittmar E N, Quirk K C, and Smith M A (2022) Buprenorphine initiation strategies for opioid use disorder and pain management: A systematic review.

Though rarely available, opioid agonist therapy (OAT) may be one way to improve HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes after release. Of the 69 HIV-infected prisoners enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of directly administered antiretroviral therapy, 48 (70%) met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. Of these, 30 (62.5%) selected OAT, either as methadone (N = 7, 14.5%) or buprenorphine/naloxone (BPN/NLX; N = 23, 48.0%). Twelve-week HIV and substance abuse treatment outcomes are reported as a sub-study for those selecting BPN/NLX. Retention was high: 21 (91%) completed BPN/NLX induction and 17 (74%) remained on BPN/NLX after 12 weeks. Compared with baseline, the proportion with a non-detectable viral load (61% vs 63% log(10) copies/mL) and mean CD4 count (367 vs 344 cells/mL) was unchanged at 12 weeks. Opiate-negative urine testing remained 83% for the 21 who completed induction. Using means from 10-point Likert scales, opioid craving was reduced from 6.0 to 1.8 within 3 days of BPN/NLX induction and satisfaction remained high at 9.5 throughout the 12 weeks.

Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) effectively reduces relapse to alcohol in alcohol dependent persons, yet it remains unexamined among criminal justice system (CJS) populations transitioning to the community. METHODS: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of XR-NTX to improve HIV treatment outcomes via reducing relapse to alcohol use after prison release for HIV-infected hazardous drinking and alcohol dependent prisoners is discussed. RESULTS: Acceptability of study participation is high with 86% of those referred who met eligibility criteria and 85% of those who were able to receive injections prior to release accepted injections, yet important implementation issues are identified and addressed during the study and are discussed in this paper. CONCLUSION: Medication-assisted therapies for prevention of relapse to alcohol use for CJS populations transitioning to the community, especially for HIV-infected patients, are urgently needed in order to reduce alcohol relapse after release and improve HIV treatment outcomes and contribute to improved individual and public health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Springer SA ; Altice FL ; Herme M ; Di Paola A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2013.12.006 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAlcoholism/*drug therapy\r\nAnti-Retroviral Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nHIV Infections/*drug therapy\r\nHealth Status\r\nHumans\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nMental Health\r\nNaltrexone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\n*Prisoners\r\nResearch Design\r\nRisk-Taking\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nAlcohol use disorder\r\nExtended-release naltrexone\r\nHIV\r\nHazardous drinking\r\nPrisoners\r\nRandomized controlled trial","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Springer SA, Altice FL, Herme M, and Di Paola A (2014) Design and methods of a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of extended-release naltrexone for alcohol dependent and hazardous drinking prisoners with HIV who are transitioning to the community..

METHODS: Two double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of XR-NTX for inmates with HIV disease transitioning to the community with (1) alcohol use disorders (AUDs) or (2) opioid use disorders, are underway. Reasons for not accepting XR-NTX and an evaluation of differences in demographic features between those who were retained on study drug and those who did not return for their second injection post-release are discussed. RESULTS: 70% of eligible persons consented to participate; almost 90% received their first injection; and almost 60% returned for their first injection after release. Variables found to be associated (p<0.10) with returning for the second injection included: not meeting criteria for hazardous drinking (p=0.035; OR 0.424 (CI 0.191-0.941)); being prescribed antiretroviral therapy (p=0.068; OR 2.170 (CI 0.943-4.992)); expressing experiencing serious depression 30 days prior to incarceration (p=0.068; OR 1.889 (CI 0.955-3.737)); not having a positive cocaine urine screen on the day of release (DOR) (p=0.011; OR 0.258 (CI 0.091-0.729)); and not meeting criteria for an AUD plus any substance use disorder (p=0.068; OR 0.521 (CI 0.259-1.048)).

However, drop-out rates are high, and many patients do not reach desired outcomes. Understanding patients' and healthcare providers' experiences with the treatment can provide valuable information to improve the quality of OMT and to increase acceptability and accessibility of services. The aim of this systematic review is to explore and synthesise the experiences of OMT among persons with opioid dependence and health care providers, to inform policy makers and practitioners on how to improve OMT outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative evidence synthesis. We systematically searched in electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and nordic databases) and searched for grey literature. As we identified many studies that met our inclusion criteria, we purposively sampled a manageable number of studies to include in this review. Two researchers independently extracted and coded data from the included studies and used the Andersen's healthcare utilization model to organize and develop codes. We assessed the methodological limitations of the studies, and our confidence in the findings using GRADE CERQual. RESULTS: We retrieved 56 relevant studies and purposively sampled 24 qualitative studies of patients' and healthcare providers' experiences with OMT. Our analyses resulted in six main themes: (1) External stigma prevents engagement and retention in treatment, (2) Being identified as in OMT contributed to an increased experience of stigma (3) Inadequate knowledge and expertise among healthcare providers affected patients' treatment experiences, (4) Quality of communication between personnel and patients impacts patients' engagement with treatment and treatment outcomes, (5) Patients wanted help with many aspects of their lives not just medication, and (6) Balancing positive expectations of OMT with treatment stigma. We found that stigma was an overarching theme across these themes. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that OMT could be more beneficial for patients if treatment programs prioritize efforts to diminish societal and OMT provider stigma and find strategies to better address patient needs. Initiatives should focus on improving treatment knowledge among providers, encouraging the use of client perspectives, considering the context of family members, and establishing a more holistic and flexible treatment environment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Steiro A ; Hestevik CH ; Muller AE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/s12913-024-10778-7 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nDelivery of Health Care\r\nFamily\r\nHealth Personnel\r\nQualitative Research\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nHealth policy\r\nOpioid maintenance treatment\r\nOpioid-related disorders\r\nPatient and health providers\r\nQualitative evidence synthesis\r\nUser experience","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Steiro A, Hestevik CH, and Muller AE (2024) Patient's and healthcare provider's experiences with Opioid Maintenance Treatment (OMT): a qualitative evidence synthesis..

We aimed to compare the effectiveness of supervised injectable treatment with medicinal heroin (diamorphine or diacetylmorphine) or supervised injectable methadone versus optimised oral methadone for chronic heroin addiction. METHODS: In this multisite, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled chronic heroin addicts who were receiving conventional oral treatment (>or=6 months), but continued to inject street heroin regularly (>or=50% of days in preceding 3 months). Randomisation by minimisation was used to assign patients to receive supervised injectable methadone, supervised injectable heroin, or optimised oral methadone. Treatment was provided for 26 weeks in three supervised injecting clinics in England. Primary outcome was 50% or more of negative specimens for street heroin on weekly urinalysis during weeks 14-26. Primary analysis was by intention to treat; data were adjusted for centre, regular crack use at baseline, and treatment with optimised oral methadone at baseline. Percentages were calculated with Rubin's rules and were then used to estimate numbers of patients in the multiple imputed samples. This study is registered, ISRCTN01338071. FINDINGS: Of 301 patients screened, 127 were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive injectable methadone (n=42 patients), injectable heroin (n=43), or oral methadone (n=42); all patients were included in the primary analysis. At 26 weeks, 80% (n=101) patients remained in assigned treatment: 81% (n=34) on injectable methadone, 88% (n=38) on injectable heroin, and 69% (n=29) on oral methadone. Patients on injectable heroin were significantly more likely to have achieved the primary outcome (72% [n=31]) than were those on oral methadone (27% [n=11], OR 7.42, 95% CI 2.69-20.46, p<0.0001; adjusted: 66% [n=28] vs 19% [n=8], 8.17, 2.88-23.16, p<0.0001), with number needed to treat of 2.17 (95% CI 1.60-3.97). For injectable methadone (39% [n=16]; adjusted: 30% [n=14]) versus oral methadone, the difference was not significant (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.66-4.60, p=0.264; adjusted: 1.79, 0.67-4.82, p=0.249). For injectable heroin versus injectable methadone, a significant difference was recorded (4.26, 1.63-11.14, p=0.003; adjusted: 4.57, 1.71-12.19, p=0.002), but the study was not powered for this comparison. Differences were evident within the first 6 weeks of treatment. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with supervised injectable heroin leads to significantly lower use of street heroin than does supervised injectable methadone or optimised oral methadone. UK Government proposals should be rolled out to support the positive response that can be achieved with heroin maintenance treatment for previously unresponsive chronic heroin addicts.

AIMS: To synthesise published findings for treatment with SIH for refractory heroin-dependence through systematic review and meta-analysis, and to examine the political and scientific response to these findings. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of SIH treatment were identified through database searching, and random effects pooled efficacy was estimated for SIH treatment. Methodological quality was assessed according to criteria set out by the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS: Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Across the trials, SIH treatment improved treatment outcome, i.e. greater reduction in the use of illicit 'street' heroin in patients receiving SIH treatment compared with control groups (most often receiving MMT). CONCLUSIONS: SIH is found to be an effective way of treating heroin dependence refractory to standard treatment. SIH may be less safe than MMT and therefore requires more clinical attention to manage greater safety issues. This intensive intervention is for a patient population previously considered unresponsive to treatment. Inclusion of this low-volume, high-intensity treatment can now improve the impact of comprehensive healthcare provision.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Strang J ; Groshkova T ; Uchtenhagen A ; van den Brink W ; Haasen C ; Schechter MT ; Lintzeris N ; Bell J ; Pirona A ; Oviedo-Joekes E ; Simon R ; Metrebian N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1192/bjp.bp.114.149195 ","Keywords":"Heroin/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects\r\nHeroin Dependence/*drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Strang J, Groshkova T, Uchtenhagen A, van den Brink W, Haasen C, Schechter MT, Lintzeris N, Bell J, Pirona A, Oviedo-Joekes E, Simon R, and Metrebian N (2015) Heroin on trial: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials of diamorphine-prescribing as treatment for refractory heroin addiction†..

The chronic relapsing nature of drug dependence means that helping a patient to achieve abstinence is often difficult. Naltrexone blocks the effects of ingested heroin; however, evidence is conflicting regarding the best delivery method. OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose of the trial was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of extended-release naltrexone versus standard oral naltrexone versus relapse prevention therapy without medication for opioid use disorder (OUD). DESIGN: This was a 3-year, definitive, three-centre, three-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Two specialist NHS outpatient addiction clinics: one in London and one in Birmingham. PARTICIPANTS: Planned study sample - 300 adult patients with OUD who had completed detoxification. INTERVENTIONS: One iGen/Atral-Cipan Extended Release Naltrexone device (iGen/Atral-Cipan, Castanheira do Ribatejo, Portugal) (765 mg naltrexone or placebo) at day 0 of study week 1. Three weekly directly observed active or placebo oral naltrexone tablets (2 × 50 mg, Monday and Wednesday; 3 × 50 mg, Friday) at day 0 of study week 1 (for 4 weeks) and then an 8-week regimen of patient-administered dosing at the same dosing level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of heroin-negative urine drug screen (UDS) results at the end of the 12-week post-randomisation time point. RESULTS: Six patients were recruited and randomised to receive study interventions. Two patients had no positive UDS samples for heroin during the 12-week treatment period, one patient had only one positive UDS sample and the remaining patients had two, six and eight positive UDS results for heroin. All patients had at least one missed clinic visit (range 1-14). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable problems were encountered with (1) the stipulated requirement of a validated 'detoxified' status prior to the initiation of the study naltrexone, (2) the requirement for a consent cooling-off period and (3) delays awaiting the surgical implant procedure. Major upheaval to the organisation and delivery of NHS community treatment services across England led to extremely poor levels of actual entry of patients into the trial. Research-vital clinical and procedural requirements were, therefore, more challenging to implement. The potential therapeutic value of the opioid antagonist naltrexone still needs clear investigation, including comparison of the established oral form with the new ultra-long-acting depot implant formulations (for which no licensed products exist in Europe). Despite the small number of study participants, some tentative conclusions can be reached, relevant to potential future work. The blinding of the active/placebo medications appeared to be good. Self-report was not sufficient to detect instances of heroin use. Self-report plus UDS information provided a fuller picture. Instances of lapsed heroin use were not necessarily followed by full relapse, and future work should consider the lapse-relapse relationship. The prison release setting also warrants special consideration. In future, investigators should consider seeking ethics approval for studies in which clinical procedures to accelerate the treatment process are permitted, even if outside orthodox clinical practice, if they address a clinical need at the time of challenge and clinical risk. In addition, it may be appropriate to seek exemption from the ordinary requirement of a cooling-off period after securing consent because it is often essential to initiate treatment promptly.

This study examined the acute-on-chronic effects on heroin craving, mood, and opioid-like symptoms of a single, extra half-dose on top of the patient's prescribed daily methadone dosage. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced crossover design was used to test the safety of this practice and the hypotheses that extra methadone would reduce heroin craving and improve mood, with greater responses in lower-dose (20-60 mg/d) as compared with higher-dose patients (80-120 mg/d). Fourteen stabilized methadone-maintained volunteers of each dose group were examined predrug and postdrug on 2 separate days using a range of self-report measures (Heroin Craving Questionnaire, visual analogs, Befindlichkeits-Skala, Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale, and Opioid Agonist Scale). Additionally, patients' expectations and guesses regarding treatment were assessed predrug and postdrug, respectively. No adverse effects occurred after extra methadone. Participants could not reliably distinguish between extra methadone and placebo. Repeated-measures analyses of variance showed no effects of extra methadone on heroin craving and opioid agonist effects. However, extra methadone improved mood on the Befindlichkeits-Skala (F1/24 = 4.71, P = 0.04), with marginally greater effects in lower-dose patients ((F1/24 = 2.94, P = 0.099). A single 50% extra methadone dose is most likely safe in patients on stable methadone doses of 20 to 120 mg/d and may improve patients' mood. Extra methadone may constitute an important factor in the attractiveness of maintenance treatment and may enhance treatment outcome. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Comments":"2010-08-26","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Strasser J ; Wiesbeck G A; Meier N ; Stohler R ; Dürsteler-Macfarland K M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/JCP.0b013e3181e6df49","Keywords":"methadone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical trial\r\ncontrolled clinical trial\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug megadose\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfemale\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhuman\r\nlow drug dose\r\nmale\r\nmood\r\npriority journal\r\nquestionnaire\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nself report\r\nvisual analog scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Strasser J, Wiesbeck G A, Meier N, Stohler R, and Dürsteler-Macfarland K M (2010) Effects of a single 50% extra dose of methadone on heroin craving and mood in lower-versus higher-dose methadone patients.

AIM: Our aim was to publish an interactive summary of all peer-reviewed interventional and observational trials assessing the treatment of OUD and common clinical outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and Web of Science were queried using multiple OUD-related MESH terms, without date limitations, for English-language publications. Inclusions were human subjects, treatment of OUD, OUD patient or community-level outcomes, and systematic reviews of OUD interventions. Exclusions were laboratory studies, reviews, and case reports. Two reviewers independently scanned abstracts for inclusion before coding eligible full-text articles by pre-specified filters: research design, study population, study setting, intervention, outcomes, sample size, study duration, geographical region, and funding sources. RESULTS: The OUD Evidence Map (https://med.nyu.edu/research/lee-lab/research/opioid-use-disorder-treatment-evidence-map) identified and assessed 12,933 relevant abstracts through 2020. We excluded 9455 abstracts and full text reviewed 2839 manuscripts; 888 were excluded, 1591 were included in the final evidence map. The most studied OUD interventions were methadone (n = 754 studies), buprenorphine (n = 499), and naltrexone (n = 134). The most common outcomes were heroin/opioid use (n = 708), treatment retention (n = 557), and non-opioid drug use (n = 368). Clear gaps included a wider array of opioid agonists for treatment, digital behavioral interventions, studies of OUD treatments in criminal justice settings, and overdose as a clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: This OUD Evidence Map highlights the importance of pharmacologic interventions for OUD and reductions in opioid use. Future iterations will update results annually and scan policy-level interventions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sugarman A ; Vittitow A ; Cheng A ; Malone M ; McDonald R ; Pace N ; Williams O ; Tofighi B ; McNeely J ; Schatz D ; Roberts T ; Hey SP ; Garrity K ; Lindquist K ; Lee JD ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109657 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nEvidence map\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid use disorder","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sugarman A, Vittitow A, Cheng A, Malone M, McDonald R, Pace N, Williams O, Tofighi B, McNeely J, Schatz D, Roberts T, Hey SP, Garrity K, Lindquist K, and Lee JD (2022) Opioid Use Disorder Treatments: An Evidence Map..

Principles of learning suggest an antagonist works through extinguishing drug-seeking behavior, as episodes of drug use (\"testing the blockade\") fail to produce reinforcement. We hypothesized that opiate use would moderate the effect of naltrexone, specifically, that opiate-positive urines precede dropout in the placebo group, but not in the active-medication groups. METHODS: An 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N=57), compared the efficacy of low (192 mg) and high (384 mg) doses of a long-acting injectable naltrexone (Depotrex) with placebo (Comer et al., 2006). A Cox proportional hazard model was fit, modeling time-to-dropout as a function of treatment assignment and urine toxicology during treatment. RESULTS: Interaction of opiate urines with treatment group was significant. Opiate-positive urines predicted dropout on placebo and low-dose, but less so on high-dose naltrexone, where positive urines were more likely followed by sustained abstinence. Among patients with no opiate-positive urines, retention was higher in both low- and high-dose naltrexone conditions, compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm that injection naltrexone produces extinction of drug-seeking behavior after episodes of opiate use. Adequate dosage appears important, as low-dose naltrexone resembled the placebo group; opiate positive urines were likely to be followed by dropout from treatment. The observation of high treatment retention among naltrexone-treated patients who do not test the blockade, suggests naltrexone may also exert direct effects on opiate-taking behavior that do not depend on extinction, perhaps by attenuating craving or normalizing dysregulated hedonic or neuroendocrine systems.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sullivan MA ; Bisaga A ; Mariani JJ ; Glass A ; Levin FR ; Comer SD ; Nunes EV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2013.05.030 ","Keywords":"Adolescent\r\nAdult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Dropouts/statistics & numerical data\r\nProportional Hazards Models\r\nLong-acting injectable naltrexone\r\nOpiate dependence\r\nOpioid antagonist\r\nTreatment retention\r\nUrine toxicology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sullivan MA, Bisaga A, Mariani JJ, Glass A, Levin FR, Comer SD, and Nunes EV (2013) Naltrexone treatment for opioid dependence: does its effectiveness depend on testing the blockade?.

We compared behavioral naltrexone therapy (BNT) to compliance enhancement (CE) and tested efficacy of single-dose injection naltrexone (XR-NTX; 384 mg) with behavioral therapies at further improving adherence to oral naltrexone. METHODS: A 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n=125) compared four treatment conditions following inpatient detoxification and oral naltrexone induction: (1) BNT+XR-NTX; (2) BNT+placebo injection; (3) CE+XR-NTX; and (4) CE+placebo injection. All participants were maintained on oral naltrexone throughout the trial. Primary outcome was retention in treatment. RESULTS: Of 89 randomized participants, 78.7% (70/89) completed 4 weeks, 58.2% (54/89) completed 8 weeks, 47.2% (42/89) completed 12 weeks, and 25.8% (23/89) completed 24 weeks. A Cox proportional hazards regression modeled time to dropout as a function of treatment condition, baseline opioid dependence severity (bags per day of heroin use), and their interaction. Interaction of conditions by baseline severity was significant (X3(2)=9.19, p=0.027). For low-severity patients (≤ 6 bags/day), retention was highest in the BNT-XR-NTX group (60% at 6 months), as hypothesized. For high-severity (>6 bags/day) patients, BNT-XR-NTX did not perform as well, due to high early attrition. CONCLUSION: For low-severity heroin users, single-dose XR-NTX improved long-term treatment retention when combined with behavioral therapy. In higher-severity opioid-dependent patients, XR-NTX was less helpful, perhaps because, combined with oral naltrexone, it produced higher blood levels and more withdrawal discomfort. When cost considerations recommend oral naltrexone following XR-NTX, the latter should be phased in slowly.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sullivan MA ; Bisaga A ; Glass A ; Mishlen K ; Pavlicova M ; Carpenter KM ; Mariani JJ ; Levin FR ; Nunes EV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.11.028 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\n*Behavior Therapy/methods\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intravenous\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*diagnosis/psychology/*therapy\r\nPatient Compliance/psychology\r\n*Patient Dropouts/psychology\r\nInjection naltrexone\r\nOpiate dependence treatment\r\nOpioid antagonist\r\nOral naltrexone\r\nPharmacotherapy trials","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sullivan MA, Bisaga A, Glass A, Mishlen K, Pavlicova M, Carpenter KM, Mariani JJ, Levin FR, and Nunes EV (2015) Opioid use and dropout in patients receiving oral naltrexone with or without single administration of injection naltrexone..

METHODS: This open-label study included adult opioid-dependent subjects stabilized on 8/2 to 32/8 mg/d of SLBN for a minimum of 30 days. Study subjects were converted to a bioequivalent dose of BBN and maintained for 12 weeks. FINDINGS: A total of 249 subjects (mean age 38.7 years, 65.9% male) were converted from SLBN to a single daily dose of BBN, and 79.1% completed the 12-week study. Adverse events and withdrawal symptoms led to discontinuation in 2.4% and 2.0% of BBN-treated subjects, respectively. Rates of constipation reported at baseline declined from 41% just before the initial BBN dose and within 24 hours of the last SLBN dose to 13% after 12 weeks of BBN treatment; treatment-emergent constipation was reported by 2.8% of BBN-treated subjects. Oral mucosal abnormalities were identified in 5% and 0.6% of systematic oral examinations in SLBN- and BBN-treated subjects, respectively. A total of 34 subjects had Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale total scores ranging from 10 to 25 (overall mean, 13.8) within 24 hours of taking their last SLBN dose, and scores for these subjects were reduced to a range of 0 to 3 (overall mean, 0.7) at 3 hours after the initial dose of BBN. Treatment compliance was high (108%); <1% of urine samples were buprenorphine-free, and 92.4% of BBN-treated subjects did not have a urine sample that tested positive for a non-prescribed opioid. A total of 91.3% subjects rated the taste of BBN as pleasant or neutral, and 82.5% rated BBN ease of use as easy or neutral. The overall mean final dose of BBN was 8.0/1.4 mg/d, yielding a 2:1 buprenorphine conversion ratio. IMPLICATIONS: Although these results should be considered preliminary due to the open-label design, BBN was overall safe and well tolerated, and seemed to provide adequate symptom control, in the treatment of opioid-dependent subjects previously controlled on SLBN for a minimum of 30 days. There was good adherence to study medication and favorable patient acceptance of the buccal formulation. The SLBN/BBN buprenorphine conversion ratio was 2:1.

Assessments were conducted at baseline and 22 and 34 weeks after randomization. Using an intention to treat approach, we constructed linear regression models to compare groups at each follow-up. At 22 weeks, adjusted mean daily morphine-equivalent opioid dose in the past week (primary outcome) was lower in the taper support group, but this difference was not statistically significant (adjusted mean difference = -42.9 mg; 95% confidence interval, -92.42 to 6.62; P = .09). Pain severity ratings (0-10 numeric rating scale) decreased in both groups at 22 weeks, with no significant difference between groups (adjusted mean difference = -.68; 95% confidence interval, -2.01 to .64; P = .30). The taper support group improved significantly more than the usual care group in self-reported pain interference, pain self-efficacy, and prescription opioid problems at 22 weeks (all P-values < .05). This taper support intervention is feasible and shows promise in reducing opioid dose while not increasing pain severity or interference. PERSPECTIVE: In a pilot randomized trial comparing a prescription opioid taper support intervention to usual care, lower opioid doses and pain severity ratings were observed at 22 weeks in both groups. The groups did not differ significantly at 22 weeks in opioid dose or pain severity, but the taper support group improved significantly more in pain interference, pain self-efficacy, and perceived opioid problems. These results support the feasibility and promise of this opioid taper support intervention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sullivan MD ; Turner JA ; DiLodovico C ; D'Appollonio A ; Stephens K ; Chan YF ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jpain.2016.11.003 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAged\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nAnxiety Disorders/etiology\r\nChronic Pain/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology\r\nOutcome Assessment, Health Care\r\n*Outpatients\r\nPain Measurement\r\nPilot Projects\r\nPrescription Drug Misuse/statistics & numerical data\r\nSelf Care/*methods\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nChronic opioid therapy\r\nopioid dose taper\r\npain intensity\r\npain interference\r\npain self-management","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sullivan MD, Turner JA, DiLodovico C, D'Appollonio A, Stephens K, and Chan YF (2017) Prescription Opioid Taper Support for Outpatients With Chronic Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial..

The authors conducted a trial examining the efficacy of two methods of outpatient opioid detoxification for induction to XR-naltrexone. METHOD: Participants were 150 opioid-dependent adults randomly assigned 2:1 to one of two outpatient detoxification regimens, naltrexone-assisted detoxification or buprenorphine-assisted detoxification, followed by an injection of XR-naltrexone. Naltrexone-assisted detoxification lasted 7 days and included a single day of buprenorphine followed by ascending doses of oral naltrexone along with clonidine and other adjunctive medications. Buprenorphine-assisted detoxification included a 7-day buprenorphine taper followed by a week-long delay before administration of XR-naltrexone, consistent with official prescribing information for XR-naltrexone. Participants from both groups received behavioral therapy focused on medication adherence and a second dose of XR-naltrexone. RESULTS: Compared with participants in the buprenorphine-assisted detoxification condition, participants assigned to naltrexone-assisted detoxification were significantly more likely to be successfully inducted to XR-naltrexone (56.1% compared with 32.7%) and to receive the second injection at week 5 (50.0% compared with 26.9%). Both models adjusted for primary type of opioid use, route of opioid administration, and morphine equivalents at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of low-dose naltrexone, in conjunction with single-day buprenorphine dosing and adjunctive nonopioid medications, for initiating adults with opioid dependence to XR-naltrexone. This strategy offers a promising alternative to the high rates of attrition and relapse currently observed with agonist tapers in both inpatient and outpatient settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sullivan M ; Bisaga A ; Pavlicova M ; Choi CJ ; Mishlen K ; Carpenter KM ; Levin FR ; Dakwar E ; Mariani JJ ; Nunes EV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.16050548 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\n*Ambulatory Care\r\nBehavior Therapy\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nClonidine/administration & dosage\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nRemission Induction\r\nSecondary Prevention\r\nYoung Adult\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nDetoxification\r\nInjectable Naltrexone\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpioid Dependence\r\nOutpatient","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sullivan M, Bisaga A, Pavlicova M, Choi CJ, Mishlen K, Carpenter KM, Levin FR, Dakwar E, Mariani JJ, and Nunes EV (2017) Long-Acting Injectable Naltrexone Induction: A Randomized Trial of Outpatient Opioid Detoxification With Naltrexone Versus Buprenorphine..

From 2014 to 2015, opioid-involved deaths increased by 15%, from 9.0 to 10.4 per 100,000 population. Thus, effective relapse prevention treatments are warranted. Injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) prevents relapse to opioid dependence and requires initial detoxification, which can be a barrier to treatment initiation. There is no clinical consensus on the ideal treatment regimen to promote induction onto XR-NTX. Here we present data on the efficacy and safety of oral naltrexone (NTX) titration, combined with buprenorphine (BUP) taper and standing ancillary medications to facilitate transition onto XR-NTX in outpatients with OUD. Methods: In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02537574), patients with OUD were randomized 1:1:1 to receive NTX + BUP (NTX/BUP), NTX + placebo BUP (NTX/PBO-B), or placebo NTX + placebo BUP (PBO-N/PBO-B) in an outpatient setting. Patients received 7 days of ascending doses of NTX vs PBO-N, concurrent with descending BUP taper vs PBO-B in addition to standing ancillary medications (clonidine, clonazepam, and trazodone), and daily psychoeducational counseling. On Day 8, patients passing a naloxone challenge (1.2 mg IM) received XR-NTX. Withdrawal symptoms were assessed with the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients who received and tolerated an XRNTX injection, as demonstrated by mild (COWS 12 or SOWS 10) opioid withdrawal symptoms following XRNTX administration. Patients were also assessed for substance use, vital signs, withdrawal symptoms, and opioid craving daily throughout the treatment period and at regular intervals during a 92-day follow-up period. Results: Of the 374 randomized patients, rates of transition to XR-NTX were comparable among groups: NTX/BUP (47%) vs NTX/PBO-B (41%) vs PBO-N/PBO-B (47%). Thus, the study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating the efficacy of NTX/BUP. Opioid-negative urines during the 8-day treatment period were significantly higher in the NTX/BUP-(24.5%) versus PBO-N/PBO-B-(13.4%) treated groups (P =.03). To further explore potential differences in opioid abstinence during this study, urine samples collected from all patients across all 3 treatment arms (days 2-8) were analyzed to control for expected opioid-positive samples at study entry. These analyses confirmed opioid abstinence during the treatment period was significantly higher in the NTX/BUP-(300/659 [45.5%]) versus PBO-N/PBO-B-(210/573 [36.6%]) and NTX/PBO-B-(263/702 [37.5%]) treated groups (P =.003, P =.002, respectively). After the XR-NTX injection, SOWS scores were lower in the NTX/BUP-(3.3) versus PBO-N/PBO-B(7.0) treated groups (P =.01). Daily peak COWS scores were in the mild range (12) at treatment outset and rapidly decreased during the first few days of treatment for all groups. Mean opioid craving scores declined steadily with treatment and continued decreasing post-XR-NTX for all groups. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and consistent with opioid withdrawal symptoms. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (5.8%), anxiety (5.0%), and nausea (4.0%). Conclusions: Use of oral NTX/BUP during detoxification and induction may be an option to reduce opioid use and facilitate a safe transition onto XR-NTX. Summary: Management of opioid withdrawal symptoms and initiation of XR-NTX treatment was achieved with a combination of pharmacological and psychoeducational interventions in an outpatient setting, showing little difference in rates of transition among groups. A 7-day fixed-dose ancillary treatment regimen was well tolerated and helped ameliorate withdrawal symptoms.","Comments":"2018-08-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sullivan M ; Mannelli P ; Yu M ; Nangia N ; Graham C ; Webster I ; Andrew Tompkins ; D  ; Kosten T ; Akerman S ; Silverman B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/ajad.12753","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nclonazepam\r\nclonidine\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nplacebo\r\ntrazodone\r\nadult\r\nadverse event\r\nanxiety\r\nconference abstract\r\nconsensus\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncounseling\r\ndetoxification\r\ndiarrhea\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug combination\r\ndrug safety\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nhuman tissue\r\ninjection\r\nmale\r\nnausea\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutpatient\r\npharmacokinetics\r\nphase 3 clinical trial (topic)\r\npotential difference\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nrelapse\r\nsubstance use\r\nsystematic review\r\ntitrimetry\r\nurine sampling\r\nvisually impaired person\r\nvital sign\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sullivan M, Mannelli P, Yu M, Nangia N, Graham C, Webster I, Andrew Tompkins, D , Kosten T, Akerman S, and Silverman B (2018) Outpatient transition to extended-release naltrexone in patients with opioid-use disorder.

Long-acting injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone), administered monthly, circumvents the need for daily pill taking, potentially improving adherence, and has been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing opioid use over 6 months of treatment. This open-label trial compared the outcomes of patients with opioid use disorder treated with XR-naltrexone or oral naltrexone in combination with behavioral therapy. METHOD: Sixty opioid-dependent adults completed inpatient opioid withdrawal and were transitioned to oral naltrexone. They were stratified by severity of opioid use (six or fewer bags versus more than six bags of heroin per day) and randomly assigned (1:1) to continue treatment with oral naltrexone (N=32) or XR-naltrexone (N=28) for 24 weeks. The first dose of XR-naltrexone (380 mg) was administered prior to discharge, with monthly doses thereafter, and oral naltrexone was given in a 50-mg daily dose. All participants received weekly behavioral therapy to support treatment and adherence to naltrexone. RESULTS: A Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for race, gender, route of use, and baseline opioid use severity indicated that significantly more patients were retained in treatment for 6 months in the XR-naltrexone group (16 of 28 patients, 57.1%) than in the oral naltrexone group (nine of 32 patients, 28.1%) (hazard ratio=2.18, 95% CI=1.07, 4.43). CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving XR-naltrexone had twice the rate of treatment retention at 6 months compared with those taking oral naltrexone. These results support the use of XR-naltrexone combined with behavioral therapy as an effective treatment for patients seeking opioid withdrawal and nonagonist treatment for preventing relapse to opioid use disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sullivan MA ; Bisaga A ; Pavlicova M ; Carpenter KM ; Choi CJ ; Mishlen K ; Levin FR ; Mariani JJ ; Nunes EV ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17070732 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdult\r\n*Behavior Therapy\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nMale\r\nMedication Adherence\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nRecurrence\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nInjection Naltrexone\r\nOpioid Antagonist\r\nOpioid Use Disorder\r\nOral Naltrexone\r\nTreatment Retention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sullivan MA, Bisaga A, Pavlicova M, Carpenter KM, Choi CJ, Mishlen K, Levin FR, Mariani JJ, and Nunes EV (2019) A Randomized Trial Comparing Extended-Release Injectable Suspension and Oral Naltrexone, Both Combined With Behavioral Therapy, for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder..

This study aims to evaluate changes in social functioning, family relations and drug-related criminal behaviour among MMT clients in China. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Both English and Chinese literature databases, including PubMed, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journals Database (CQVIP), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data, were comprehensively searched over the period 2004-2014 for studied indicators. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were conducted according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) Statement. Meta-analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Biostat software. RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles were included in this review (1 in English and 37 in Chinese). The self-reported arrest rate decreased from 13.1% (95% CI 9.1% to 18.5%) at baseline to 3.4% (95% CI 1.5% to 7.7%) and 4.3% (95% CI 1.6% to 11.4%) after 6 and 12 months of MMT intervention, respectively. The rate of drug selling decreased from 7.6% (95% CI 3.8% to 14.8%) at baseline to 1.9% (95% CI 0.6% to 6.2%) and 3.0% (95% CI 1.0% to 8.9%) after 6 and 12 months of intervention, respectively. Similarly, the rates of selling sex for drugs and drug-related crime decreased from 5.3% (95% CI 2.4% to 11.1%) and 9.9% (95% CI 6.8% to 14.2%) at baseline to 1.1% (95% CI 0.5% to 2.3%) and 3.4% (95% CI 2.5% to 4.5%) at 6 months, then to 0.8% (95% CI 0.3% to 1.9%) and 3.4% (95% CI 0.8% to 13.1%) at 12 months after treatment initiation, respectively. In contrast, the rate of employment of clients and the proportion of clients having a good relationship with their family increased substantially from 26.4% (95% CI 22.9% to 30.1%) and 37.9% (95% CI 32.0% to 44.2%) to 41.6% (95% CI 36.6% to 48.0%) and 59.6% (95% CI 48.1% to 70.2%) at 6 months, then to 59.8% (95% CI 52.4% to 66.8%) and 75.0% (95% CI 69.0% to 80.2%) at 12 months after treatment initiation, respectively.

In order to improve treatment adherence, a once-monthly, intramuscular, extended-release formulation of naltrexone (XR-NTX) [VIVITROL(®)] has been developed, and approved in the USA and Russia for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, after opioid detoxification. The clinical efficacy of this formulation in patients with opioid dependence was demonstrated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trial (ALK21-013; n = 250). In this trial, opioid-detoxified patients receiving XR-NTX 380 mg once every 4 weeks, in combination with psychosocial support, had a significantly higher median proportion of weeks of confirmed opioid abstinence during weeks 5-24, compared with those receiving placebo (primary endpoint). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving XR-NTX achieved total confirmed abstinence during this period than those receiving placebo. XR-NTX was also associated with a significantly greater reduction in opioid craving and a significantly longer treatment retention period than placebo. XR-NTX was generally well tolerated in the phase III trial. The most common (incidence ≥5 %) treatment-emergent adverse events that also occurred more frequently with XR-NTX than with placebo were hepatic enzyme abnormalities, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, hypertension, influenza and injection-site pain. Thus, XR-NTX is a useful treatment option for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Syed YY ; Keating GM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-013-0110-x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nNaltrexone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*prevention & control\r\nSecondary Prevention","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Syed YY, and Keating GM (2013) Extended-release intramuscular naltrexone (VIVITROL®): a review of its use in the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence in detoxified patients..

DESIGN: Naturalistic, 4-week pilot study in out patients. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: All our patients (N = 12) on buprenorphine-naloxone combination (Suboxone) received their medication for 6 days in a compliance-monitoring device (PharmaDDSi, StoraEnso), which registers date and time of tablet removal. Patients were instructed to take all tablets as one dose. Time cues were displayed and discussed with the patients during their weekly visits for supervised drug administration and counseling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regularity of registered time cues, treatment costs in comparison with routine treatment, patients' answers from a questionnaire on acceptability, and effect on drug diversion. RESULTS: Six patients showed good compliance, in two patients irregularities were minor, but in two others lack of adherence to treatment instructions was detected. Patients with several comorbid psychiatric diagnoses showed on an average the longest intervals between removal of first and last tablet of the daily dose. One-fourth of the patients reported that compliance monitoring had helped to avoid diversion. Total cost savings during the 4-week period was a reduction of 39 percent, which was mainly due to fewer visits to the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance monitoring by PharmaDDSI with weekly feedback was well accepted and subjectively increased compliance with substitution treatment. Future studies will show whether a technical solution for compliance monitoring in real time can help to reduce drug abuse and noncompliance in substitution treatment and other opioid treatments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tacke U ; Uosukainen H ; Kananen M ; Kontra K ; Pentikänen H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5055/jom.2009.0032 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmbulatory Care\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination\r\nCost-Benefit Analysis\r\nCounseling\r\nDrug Administration Schedule\r\nDrug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*economics/methods\r\nElectronics, Medical/*economics\r\nFeasibility Studies\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\n*Medication Adherence\r\nNaloxone/*administration & dosage\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Satisfaction\r\nPilot Projects\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires\r\nTime Factors\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tacke U, Uosukainen H, Kananen M, Kontra K, and Pentikänen H (2009) A pilot study about the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of electronic compliance monitoring in substitution treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone combination..

Telemedicine for Evaluation, Adherence, and Medication for Hepatitis C (TEAM-C) is comparing telemedicine access to specialty medical care to usual care for management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among persons with opioid use disorder (PWOUD). PWOUD have the highest hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence and incidence, yet they infrequently receive HCV care. The study objectives are to compare access to specialty care via telemedicine to offsite specialty referral (usual care) on 1) treatment initiation, completion, and sustained virological response, 2) patient satisfaction with health care delivery, and 3) HCV reinfection after successful HCV cure. METHODS: TEAM-C is a multi-site, non-blinded, randomized pragmatic clinical trial conducted at 12 opioid treatment programs (OTP) throughout New York State that utilizes the stepped-wedge design. The unit of randomization is the OTP with a total sample size of 624 participants. HCV-infected PWOUD were treated via telemedicine or referral. Telemedicine encounters are conducted onsite in the OTP with co-administration of direct acting antivirals for HCV with medications for opioid use disorder. The primary outcome is undetectable HCV RNA obtained 12 weeks post-treatment cessation. We also follow participants for two years to assess for reinfection. CONCLUSIONS: The study utilizes a rigorous study design to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of virtual treatment for HCV integrated into behavioral treatment. We demonstrate the feasibility, engagement principles and lessons learned from the initial prospective randomized trial of telemedicine targeted to a vulnerable population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Talal AH ; Markatou M ; Sofikitou EM ; Brown LS ; Perumalswami P ; Dinani A ; Tobin JN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2021.106632 ","Keywords":"Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use\r\nHepacivirus/genetics\r\n*Hepatitis C/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\n*Hepatitis C, Chronic/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/complications/drug therapy\r\nPatient-Centered Care\r\nProspective Studies\r\n*Telemedicine\r\nHepatitis C virus\r\nPersons with opioid use disorder\r\nPragmatic clinical trial\r\nStepped-wedge design\r\nTelemedicine","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Talal AH, Markatou M, Sofikitou EM, Brown LS, Perumalswami P, Dinani A, and Tobin JN (2022) Patient-centered HCV care via telemedicine for individuals on medication for opioid use disorder: Telemedicine for Evaluation, Adherence and Medication for Hepatitis C (TEAM-C)..

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with extended-release naltrexone will be as effective as daily buprenorphine hydrochloride with naloxone hydrochloride in maintaining abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified individuals. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A 12-week, multicenter, outpatient, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway between November 1, 2012, and December 23, 2015; the last follow-up was performed on October 23, 2015. A total of 232 adult opioid-dependent (per DSM-IV criteria) individuals were recruited from outpatient addiction clinics and detoxification units and assessed for eligibility. Intention-to-treat analyses of efficacy end points were performed with all randomized participants. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to either daily oral flexible dose buprenorphine-naloxone, 4 to 24 mg/d, or extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg, administered intramuscularly every fourth week for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points (protocol) were the randomized clinical trial completion rate, the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests, and number of days of use of heroin and other illicit opioids. Secondary end points included number of days of use of other illicit substances. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting. RESULTS: Of 159 participants, mean (SD) age was 36 (8.6) years and 44 (27.7%) were women. Eighty individuals were randomized to extended-release naltrexone and 79 to buprenorphine-naloxone; 105 (66.0%) completed the trial. Retention in the extended-release naltrexone group was noninferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, -0.1; with 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.1; P = .04), with mean (SD) time of 69.3 (25.9) and 63.7 (29.9) days, correspondingly (P = .33, log-rank test). Treatment with extended-release naltrexone showed noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone on group proportion of total number of opioid-negative urine drug tests (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively, difference, 0.1 with 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.2; P < .001) and use of heroin (mean difference, -3.2 with 95% CI, -4.9 to -1.5; P < .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, -2.7 with 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.9; P < .001). Superiority analysis showed significantly lower use of heroin and other illicit opioids in the extended-release naltrexone group. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups regarding most other illicit substance use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Extended-release naltrexone was as effective as buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances and should be considered as a treatment option for opioid-dependent individuals.

Enrolment on opioid agonist therapy programmes is consequently increasing as well. As a result of these trends, more patients who present with acute pain secondary to a malignancy are also on chronic methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) for substance abuse. This combination of diagnoses presents a pain management challenge for palliative care providers. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to gather and review the available medical literature pertaining to the use of opioid analgesia in methadone-maintained patients. METHODS: The authors searched PubMED, PsychINFO, EMBASE, Clinical Key, the Cochrane Library and CINAHL from their inception to May 2015 for relevant articles. All articles that discuss opioid therapy in adult patients on methadone maintenance for opioid addiction with cancer or advanced illness were included. Data were extracted and study quality was rated independently by the authors. RESULTS: Our searches resulted in 680 hits. Of those, only 7 met inclusion criteria for the study. Most of the studies favoured the use of methadone either in scheduled divided doses every 4-8 hours or by continuous intravenous infusion. The overall strength of the evidence was poor, consisting mainly of case series, case reports and 1 single-centre retrospective cohort study lacking a comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: Treating MMT-maintained patients with methadone for analgesia may be preferable to using other opioid analgesics. However, there are many systems barriers that may make this approach challenging and the evidence favouring methadone over other opioid analgesics is weak.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Taveros MC ; Chuang EJ ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1136/bmjspcare-2016-001126 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nPain Management/*methods\r\nCancer\r\nMethadone maintenance\r\nPain\r\nopioid addiction\r\npalliative care","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Taveros MC, and Chuang EJ (2017) Pain management strategies for patients on methadone maintenance therapy: a systematic review of the literature..

HCV therapy for HCV-monoinfected methadone maintenance (MM) recipients is safe and effective. We evaluated treatment efficacy and adherence to pegylated interferon (pegIFN) among HIV/HCV coinfected MM recipients. Methods: HCV treatment-naïve, HIV-infected persons 18-65 years with chronic HCV genotype 1 on MM were prospectively enrolled in an HCV treatment study at two HIV clinics. At weekly visits pegIFN alfa-2a injections were directly administered. Daily MM recipients had morning ribavirin delivered with methadone at off-site methadone clinics. Weekly take-home MM recipients took ribavirin unsupervised. Target enrollment was 30 participants. Results: During 18 recruitment months, 11 participants were enrolled, 6 of whom received daily methadone. Mean age was 46, 64% were female, 5 were Caucasian, 4 Black and 2 Hispanic. At baseline, 82% had high HCV RNA and 55% had stage 2 fibrosis or greater. The majority (91%) were on HAART, and 82% had undetectable HIV RNA with a median CD4+ of 508cells/μL. All had polysubstance use history, non-substance-based psychiatric diagnoses and were on psychotropic medications pre-enrollment.Two (18%) participants achieved a Sustained Virologic Response (SVR). Two completed 48 treatment weeks, 5 were withdrawn due to adverse events, 2 dropped out prematurely and 2 had treatment discontinued for virologic non-response. Of on-treatment weeks, adherence to pegIFN was >99%. Conclusions: SVR rate was comparable to historic controls for coinfected genotype 1 patients, with optimal pegIFN adherence. Adverse effects often prevented therapy completion in this population. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Comments":"2011-06-14","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Taylor L E; Bowman S E; Chapman S ; Zaller N ; Stein M D; Cioe P A; Maynard M A; McGovern B H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.11.016","Keywords":"methadone\r\npeginterferon alpha2a\r\npsychotropic agent\r\nribavirin\r\nvirus RNA\r\nzidovudine\r\nadult\r\nanemia\r\nanxiety disorder\r\narticle\r\nCD4 lymphocyte count\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical trial\r\ndrug dependence\r\ndrug efficacy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nevening dosage\r\nfemale\r\ngenotype\r\nhepatitis C\r\nhighly active antiretroviral therapy\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nliver fibrosis\r\nmale\r\nmania\r\nmental disease\r\nmethadone treatment\r\ncoinfection\r\nmorning dosage\r\nmulticenter study\r\npatient compliance\r\npneumonia\r\npriority journal\r\nprospective study\r\nretinopathy\r\nsubstance abuse\r\nsuicidal ideation\r\ncopegus\r\npegasys","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Taylor L E, Bowman S E, Chapman S, Zaller N, Stein M D, Cioe P A, Maynard M A, and McGovern B H (2011) Treatment for hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in HIV-infected individuals on methadone maintenance therapy.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from January 1, 1966, to September 1, 2016. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies that reported outcomes associated with opioid detoxification among pregnant women with opioid use disorder were included. Nonoriginal research articles (case reports, editorials, reviews) and studies that failed to report outcomes for detoxification participants were excluded. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and quality was assessed using the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force Quality of Evidence scale. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of 1,315 unique abstracts identified, 15 met criteria for inclusion and included 1,997 participants, of whom 1,126 underwent detoxification. Study quality ranged from fair to poor as a result of the lack of a randomized control or comparison arm and high risk of bias across all studies. Only nine studies had a comparison arm. Detoxification completion (9-100%) and illicit drug relapse (0-100%) rates varied widely across studies depending on whether data from participants who did not complete detoxification or who were lost to follow-up were included in analyses. The reported rate of fetal loss was similar among women who did (14 [1.2%]) and did not undergo detoxification (17 [2.0%]). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence does not support detoxification as a recommended treatment intervention as a result of low detoxification completion rates, high rates of relapse, and limited data regarding the effect of detoxification on maternal and neonatal outcomes beyond delivery.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Terplan M ; Laird HJ ; Hand DJ ; Wright TE ; Premkumar A ; Martin CE ; Meyer MC ; Jones HE ; Krans EE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/AOG.0000000000002562 ","Keywords":"Female\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical \r\n      data\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*therapy\r\nPregnancy Outcome\r\nPrenatal Care/*methods\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Terplan M, Laird HJ, Hand DJ, Wright TE, Premkumar A, Martin CE, Meyer MC, Jones HE, and Krans EE (2018) Opioid Detoxification During Pregnancy: A Systematic Review..

Integrating buprenorphine/naloxone into HIV treatment settings is feasible; however, the optimal level of counseling has not been established. We conducted a 12-week randomized clinical trial of physician management (PM) versus PM plus enhanced medical management (EMM) in 47 subjects. At 12. weeks, there were no differences between the two groups in percentage of opioid negative urines (63.6% PM vs. 69.0% PM + EMM, p= .5), maximum duration of continuous abstinence (4.9 weeks PM vs. 5.2. weeks PM + EMM, p= .8) or retention (80% PM vs. 59% PM + EMM, p= .1). The percentage of subjects with detectable HIV viral loads decreased from 58% at baseline to 40% at 12. weeks across both groups (p= .02 for time) with no between group differences (p= .84 and p= .27 for the interaction). Providing more extensive counseling beyond PM is feasible in an HIV clinic, but we are unable to detect an improvement in outcomes associated with these services. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Comments":"2012-11-12","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tetrault J M; Moore B A; Barry D T; O'Connor P G; Schottenfeld R ; Fiellin D A; Fiellin L E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2012.07.011","Keywords":"NCT00317460\r\nantiretrovirus agent\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nadult\r\narticle\r\nCD4 lymphocyte count\r\nclinical article\r\ncontrolled study\r\ncounseling\r\ndisease duration\r\ndrug abuse\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nhighly active antiretroviral therapy\r\nhuman\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infected patient\r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient compliance\r\npriority journal\r\nrandomized controlled trial\r\nvirus load","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tetrault J M, Moore B A, Barry D T, O'Connor P G, Schottenfeld R, Fiellin D A, and Fiellin L E (2012) Brief versus extended counseling along with buprenorphine/naloxone for HIV-infected opioid dependent patients.

MMT is discussed in a companion article. This article describes BMT and reviews available research on its efficacy. Methods: Authors reviewed meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and individual studies of BMT from 1995 through 2012. Databases surveyed were PubMed, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress. They chose from three levels of evidence (high, moderate, and low) based on benchmarks for the number of studies and quality of their methodology. They also described the evidence of service effectiveness. Results: Sixteen adequately designed randomized controlled trials of BMT indicated a high level of evidence for its positive impact on treatment retention and illicit opioid use. Seven reviews or meta-analyses were also included. When the medication was dosed adequately, BMT and MMT showed similar reduction in illicit opioid use, but BMT was associated with less risk of adverse events. Results suggested better treatment retention with MMT. BMT was associated with improved maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy, compared with no medication-assisted treatment. Rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome were similar for mothers treated with BMT and MMT during pregnancy, but symptoms were less severe for infants whose mothers were treated with BMT. Conclusions: BMT is associated with improved outcomes compared with placebo for individuals and pregnant women with opioid use disorders. BMT should be considered for inclusion as a covered benefit.","Comments":"2014-02-21","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thomas C P; Fullerton C A; Kim M ; Montejano L ; Lyman D R; Dougherty R H; Daniels A S; Ghose S S; Delphin-Rittmon M E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ps.201300256","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaloxone\r\nopiate\r\nplacebo\r\narticle\r\nbehavior therapy\r\ncrossover procedure\r\nfetus outcome\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nmaintenance therapy\r\nMedline\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\npatient satisfaction\r\nposttraumatic stress disorder\r\npregnancy\r\nPsycINFO\r\nquasi experimental study\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nsocial work\r\nsociology\r\nsystematic review\r\nwithdrawal syndrome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thomas C P, Fullerton C A, Kim M, Montejano L, Lyman D R, Dougherty R H, Daniels A S, Ghose S S, and Delphin-Rittmon M E (2014) Medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine: Assessing the evidence.

The authors studied the overall real-world effectiveness of naltrexone implant in this patient population. METHOD: The authors assessed the effectiveness of a naltrexone implant in the treatment of coexisting heroin and amphetamine polydrug dependence in 100 heroin- and amphetamine-dependent outpatients in a 10-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The main outcome measures were retention in the study, proportion of drug-free urine samples, and improvement score on the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). Analyses were conducted in an intent-to-treat model. RESULTS: At week 10, the retention rate was 52% for patients who received a naltrexone implant and 28% for those who received a placebo implant; the proportions of drug-free urine samples were 38% and 16%, respectively, for the two groups. On the CGI improvement item, 56% of the patients in the naltrexone group showed much or very much improvement, compared with 14% of those in the placebo group (number needed to treat=3). CONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone implants resulted in higher retention in the study, decreased heroin and amphetamine use, and improved clinical condition for patients, thus providing the first evidence of an effective pharmacological treatment for this type of polydrug dependence.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tiihonen J ; Krupitsky E ; Verbitskaya E ; Blokhina E ; Mamontova O ; Föhr J ; Tuomola P ; Kuoppasalmi K ; Kiviniemi V ; Zwartau E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1176/appi.ajp.2011.11071121 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAmphetamine-Related Disorders/complications/drug therapy\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nDrug Implants\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/complications/drug therapy\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nNaltrexone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nSubstance-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnsafe Sex/drug effects","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tiihonen J, Krupitsky E, Verbitskaya E, Blokhina E, Mamontova O, Föhr J, Tuomola P, Kuoppasalmi K, Kiviniemi V, and Zwartau E (2012) Naltrexone implant for the treatment of polydrug dependence: a randomized controlled trial..

As expected, patients who received naltrexone or buprenorphine had better retention rates than patients who received a placebo or no medication. Consistent with prior research, methadone was associated with better retention than buprenorphine/naloxone. And, heroin-assisted treatment was associated with better retention than methadone among treatment-refractory patients. Only a single study examined retention in medication-assisted treatment for longer than 1 year, and studies of behavioral therapies may have lacked statistical power; thus, studies with longer-term follow-ups and larger samples are needed. Contingency management showed promise to increase retention, but other behavioral therapies to increase retention, such as supervision of medication consumption, or additional counseling, education, or support, failed to find differences between intervention and control conditions. Promising behavioral therapies to increase retention have yet to be identified.","Comments":"2016-02-04","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Timko C ; Schultz N R; Cucciare M A; Vittorio L ; Garrison-Diehn C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10550887.2016.1100960","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nplacebo\r\nbehavior therapy\r\nChinese medicine\r\ncognitive therapy\r\ncounseling\r\nfollow up\r\nhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\ntreatment duration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Timko C, Schultz N R, Cucciare M A, Vittorio L, and Garrison-Diehn C (2016) Retention in medication-assisted treatment for opiate dependence: A systematic review.

We sought to understand patient satisfaction in an OUD-specific prenatal clinic which supports home induction/titration of buprenorphine and use of outside-prescribed methadone. Study Design: Pregnant patients with OUD completed prenatal and postpartum surveys regarding satisfaction with their prescribed treatment. Surveys contained Likert scale questions. Demographic data were obtained from records. Patient satisfaction was compared between the pre-and postpartum groups, and stratified by prescribed medication. Responses were compared using Fisher’s exact tests. Results: 33 patients were included, with 28 completing prenatal, 15 completing postpartum, and 10 completing both surveys. Buprenorphine use was more common in both the prenatal and postpartum groups (75%, 73%). Most patients rated buprenorphine as a “generally satisfactory” or “excellent” medication that makes it possible to solve their opioid addiction (81% prenatal, 91% postpartum), with a minority rating it as “mixed”, “generally unsatisfactory”, or “terrible” (Figure 1). While most prenatal patients rated methadone positively for solving opioid addiction (86%), only half of postpartum patients felt similarly (50%) (Figure 2). Most buprenorphine patients (86% prenatal, 91% postpartum) and 71% of prenatal methadone patients rated dose titration positively, versus 50% of postpartum methadone patients. Postpartum methadone patients were significantly less likely to report a positive impression of side effects than postpartum buprenorphine patients (25% vs 100%, p=0.01). Conclusion: While both medications were viewed positively, postpartum methadone patients trended towards decreased satisfaction relative to those on buprenorphine, with a significantly worse impression of side effects. Given barriers to methadone adherence, the busy postpartum period may be a vulnerable time for unsatisfied patients, and further study is needed to clarify patient concerns.

In this review, we compare the pregnancy outcomes of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in clinical trials and discuss the potential behavioral and developmental effects of these agents seen in offspring in animal studies. Important clinical considerations in the management of opioid use disorder in pregnant women and their infants are also discussed. Outside of pregnancy, buprenorphine is used in combination with naloxone to reduce opioid abuse and diversion. During pregnancy, however, the use of buprenorphine as a single agent is preferred to prevent prenatal naloxone exposure. Both methadone and buprenorphine are widely used to treat opioid use disorder; however, compared with methadone, buprenorphine is associated with shorter treatment duration, less medication needed to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) symptoms, and shorter hospitalizations for neonates. Despite being the standard of care, medication-assisted treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is still underused, making it apparent that more options are necessary. Naltrexone is not a first-line treatment primarily because both detoxification and an opioid-free period are required. More research is needed to determine naltrexone safety and benefits in pregnant women. Animal studies suggest that changes in pain sensitivity, developmental processes, and behavioral responses may occur in children born to mothers receiving methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone and is an area that warrants future studies.","Comments":"2017-08-01","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tran T H; Griffin B L; Stone R H; Vest K M; Todd T J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1002/phar.1958","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nbehavior\r\nbreast feeding\r\nclinical study\r\ndevelopment\r\ndrug efficacy\r\nfemale\r\nFood and Drug Administration\r\nhuman\r\nmeta analysis\r\nneonatal abstinence syndrome\r\nnonhuman\r\nopiate addiction\r\npregnancy\r\npregnant woman\r\nrandomized controlled trial (topic)\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tran T H, Griffin B L, Stone R H, Vest K M, and Todd T J (2017) Methadone, Buprenorphine, and Naltrexone for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women.

Objectives: We conducted an add-on double-blinded, sham-controlled rTMS feasibility pilot trial to examine OUD participants undergoing methadone maintenance therapy (MMT). The current report focused on the effects of rTMS on (1) craving and heroin use behavior and (2) depression, impulsivity, and attention. Methods: Active or sham rTMS treatment was applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over a total of 11 sessions in 4 weeks (15-Hz frequency, 4 seconds per train, intertrain interval of 26 seconds, 40 trains per session) in OUD participants (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03229642). Craving, heroin use severity, urine morphine tests, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), and the Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) were measured. Results: Twenty-two OUD participants were enrolled, of which eleven (8 males) were undergoing active rTMS and nine (8 males) were in the sham rTMS group. After 12 weeks of follow-up, the active rTMS group did not show significantly greater improvements than the sham group with respect to craving, heroin use, or urine morphine test results. However, HDRS scores, BIS-11 attentional subscales, and CPTs commission T-scores (C-TS) were significantly lower in the active rTMS group (P = .003, 0.04, and 0.02, respectively) than in the sham group. Conclusion: Add-on rTMS did not appear to improve heroin use behavior but may have benefitted depressive symptoms, impulse control and attention in OUD participants undergoing MMT.","Comments":"2021-01-20","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tsai T Y; Wang T Y; Liu Y C; Lee P W; Chang W H; Lu T H; Tseng H H; Lee S Y; Chang Y H; Yang Y ; Chen P S; Chen K C; Yang Y K; Lu R B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00952990.2020.1849247","Keywords":"NCT03229642\r\ndrug rapid test\r\ndiamorphine\r\nmethadone\r\narticle\r\nattention\r\nBarratt Impulsiveness Scale\r\nclinical article\r\nclinical outcome\r\ncontinuous performance test\r\ndepression\r\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\r\ndouble blind procedure\r\ndrug craving\r\ndrug metabolism\r\ndrug urine level\r\nfemale\r\nfollow up\r\nHamilton Depression Rating Scale\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhuman\r\nimpulsiveness\r\nmale\r\nmethadone treatment\r\nopiate addiction\r\npilot study\r\nquestionnaire\r\nrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation\r\nside effect\r\ntreatment outcome\r\nurinalysis\r\nvisual analog scale","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tsai T Y, Wang T Y, Liu Y C, Lee P W, Chang W H, Lu T H, Tseng H H, Lee S Y, Chang Y H, Yang Y, Chen P S, Chen K C, Yang Y K, and Lu R B (2021) Add-on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with opioid use disorder undergoing methadone maintenance therapy.

Understanding substance use treatment experiences is important to improve access, and retention, and no review or synthesis of research addressing the treatment experiences of pregnant women exists. APPROACH: Thus, a qualitative meta-synthesis was conducted, which investigated the psychological motivators and barriers of pregnant women with OUD trying to access treatment and their perceptions of treatment. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 3844 articles were retrieved from the literature search. Nine articles met eligibility criteria, were appraised, then synthesised using a comparative thematic approach. Four themes: (i) Embodied Experiences; (ii) Institutional Pressures; (iii) Social Context; and (iv) Reconstructing Selves; indicate that women with OUD are motivated to engage in treatment to pursue the safety and custody of the unborn baby and to pursue and enact the changes necessary to claim 'normal' parenthood status. Pregnant women describe psychological and relational barriers to engaging in treatment, including anxieties about the baby's health, fears of authorities' involvement, stigma and experiencing relationships with treatment providers as constrictive or invalidating. IMPLICATIONS: Identity theory's concepts of identity verification, closed environments and master status identities illuminate the findings. Implications include recognising the salience of bodily experiences, providing medication-assisted treatment support groups and promoting validating relationships in treatment using strengths-based approaches.

METHODS: Pilot randomized controlled trial of adult patients with OUD initiating buprenorphine treatment (n = 78) at two sites (Seattle, WA and Boston, MA) from January 2019 to May 2020. Intervention was video DOT using a HIPAA-compliant smartphone application to record taking daily buprenorphine. Study smartphones, text reminders to upload a video, and calendar summaries of video DOT adherence were provided. Main outcomes were 1) percentage of 12 weekly urine drug tests (UDT) negative for illicit opioids and 2) engagement in treatment at week 12 (i.e., having an active prescription for buprenorphine within the last 7 days). RESULTS: Of 78 enrolled, 20 (26 %) were female; 29 (37 %) non-white; and 31 (40 %) homeless. The mean (standard deviation) percentage of doses confirmed by video was 31 % (34 %). In intention-to-treat analysis, the average percentage of weekly opioid negative UDT was 50 % (95 % CI: 40-63 %) in the intervention arm versus 64 % (95 % CI: 55-74 %) among controls; RR = 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.60-1.02, p = 0.07).

CONCLUSIONS: The video DOT intervention did not result in improvements in illicit opioid use and treatment engagement compared to TAU. The study was limited by low rates of intervention use.

The study aims were to describe methamphetamine/amphetamine (MA/A) use among patients treated for OUD with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP-NX) or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), and to explore associations between treatment arm and MA/A use. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from a multi-site, open-label, randomized controlled trial of XR-NTX versus BUP-NX for 24 weeks. The outcome variable was MA/A use defined by either positive urine drug toxicology or self-report. The main predictor was treatment assignment (BUP-NX v. XR-NTX). Longitudinal mixed-effects logistic regression models were fit to model the odds of MA/A use during the study. Additional predictors included study visit and baseline MA/A use. RESULTS: Among the sample of 570 participants with OUD, baseline use of MA/A was observed in 105 (18.4%). There was no significant treatment effect over the study period, though BUP-NX subjects, on average, had about half the odds of MA/A use compared to XR-NTX subjects (OR=0.50; p = 0.051). In the same model, baseline MA/A use and study visit were both significantly associated with MA/A use over time. CONCLUSION: In this sample of treated OUD patients, nearly a fifth of participants had MA/A use at baseline and the frequency of use did not decline over time: in fact, the odds of use slightly increased for each later visit. These secondary analyses found no significant difference in MA/A use between BUP-NX and XR-NTX treatment arms, however, the observation of less MA/A in the buprenorphine arm merits further investigation.

AIMS: This analysis of the German trial of heroin-assisted treatment investigates the effects on patients' health and drug use after switching from 12-month methadone to 12-month diamorphine treatment under similar study conditions. METHODS: For a period of 24 months, the state of health was explored using the Opiate Treatment Index (OTI) health scale and the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R), while drug use and social situation by an extended version of the European Addiction Severity Index (EuropASI) every 6 months. Changes in these criteria were tested for significance by repeated measures analyses. Of the 434 patients, who started the 2nd year of study treatment, 90 were methadone-diamorphine switchers, and 344 received diamorphine for 2 years. RESULTS: In the 2nd year, the methadone-diamorphine switchers succeed in catching up with the diamorphine patients. After switching to diamorphine, significant improvements in health and use of street heroin and cocaine were achieved during 1 year of diamorphine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the course of methadone-diamorphine switchers are a methodologically independent contribution toward confirming the positive effects of diamorphine treatment for difficult-to-treat opioid-dependent patients. This study supports the hypothesis that changing from optimized methadone treatment under the conditions of the clinical trial to diamorphine treatment is associated with improvements in health and drug use behavior.

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) demonstrate the best evidence for treating OUD. Adherence to and retention in MOUD, defined as continuous engagement in treatment, among adolescents and young adults, however, is incompletely understood. We examined the state of the literature regarding the association of age with adherence to and retention in MOUD using methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone among persons aged 10-24 years, along with related facilitators and barriers. All studies of MOUD were searched for that examined adherence, retention, or related concepts as an outcome variable and included adolescents or young adults. Search criteria generated 10,229 records; after removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 587 studies were identified for full-text review. Ultimately, 52 articles met inclusion criteria for abstraction and 17 were selected for qualitative coding and analysis. Younger age was consistently associated with shorter retention, although the overall quality of included studies was low. Several factors at the individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels, such as concurrent substance use, MOUD adherence, family conflict, and MOUD dosage and flexibility, appeared to have roles in MOUD retention among adolescents and young adults. Ways MOUD providers can tailor treatment to increase retention of adolescents and young adults are highlighted, as is the need for more research explaining MOUD adherence and retention disparities in this age group.","Comments":"2021-09-28","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Viera A ; Bromberg D J; Whittaker S ; Refsland B M; Stanojlović M ; Nyhan K ; Altice F L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/epirev/mxaa001","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\nnaltrexone\r\nadolescent\r\nadult\r\nchild\r\ncontrolled study\r\nfamily conflict\r\nhuman\r\nmedication compliance\r\nopiate addiction\r\noutcome variable\r\npatient compliance\r\npriority journal\r\npublication bias\r\nquality control\r\nreview\r\nsystematic review\r\nyoung adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Viera A, Bromberg D J, Whittaker S, Refsland B M, Stanojlović M, Nyhan K, and Altice F L (2020) Adherence to and Retention in Medications for Opioid Use Disorder among Adolescents and Young Adults.

However, there is scarce evidence about interventions that alleviate fatigue among PWIDs. The present study investigated the effect of integrated HCV treatment on fatigue in this population compared to the effect of standard HCV treatment, adjusted for sustained virological response of the HCV treatment. METHODS: This multi-center, randomized controlled trial evaluated fatigue as a secondary outcome of integrated HCV treatment (the INTRO-HCV trial). From May 2017 to June 2019, 276 participants in Bergen and Stavanger, Norway, were randomly assigned to receive integrated and standard HCV treatment. Integrated treatment was delivered in eight decentralized outpatient opioid agonist therapy clinics and two community care centers; standard treatment was delivered in specialized infectious disease outpatient clinics at referral hospitals. Fatigue was assessed prior to treatment and 12 weeks after treatment using the nine-item Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS-9). We applied a linear mixed model to evaluate the impact of integrated HCV treatment on changes in FSS-9 (ΔFSS-9) sum scores. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean FSS-9 sum score was 46 (standard deviation (SD): 15) for participants on integrated HCV treatment and 41 (SD: 16) for those on standard treatment. Twelve weeks after completed HCV treatment, the mean FSS-9 sum score for participants receiving integrated HCV treatment was 42 (SD: 15) and 40 (SD: 14) for those receiving standard HCV treatment. Integrated HCV treatment did not reduce the FSS-9 scores compared to standard HCV treatment (ΔFSS-9: -3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): -6.4;0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is a common symptom among PWIDs. Integrated HCV treatment is at least equal to standard HCV treatment in improving fatigue.

This study sought to examine the relative abuse liability and reinforcing efficacy of intranasal buprenorphine compared to intranasal buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid-dependent individuals. METHODS: Eleven healthy male and female volunteers physically dependent on short-acting opioids resided as inpatients during participation in this double blind, within subject, placebo-controlled study. Participants were maintained on oxycodone (30 mg/q.i.d., p.o.) throughout the 6-week study. Eight pairs of experimental sessions were conducted at ≥48 h intervals to examine the pharmacodynamic profile (Sample) and reinforcing efficacy (Self-administration the following day) of intranasal placebo, oxycodone (60 mg), buprenorphine (2, 8 & 16 mg) and buprenorphine/naloxone (2/0.5, 8/2 & 16/4 mg). Subjective, observer-rated and physiological measures were collected to assess the magnitude of opioid agonist and antagonist effects. A progressive ratio self-administration procedure assessed choices for drug versus money. RESULTS: All active doses produced opioid agonist-like effects (e.g., increased ratings of \"liking,\" and miosis) compared to placebo. The effects of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone were not reliably dose-dependent. Intranasal buprenorphine/naloxone elicited modest and transient opioid withdrawal-like effects in the first hour post-drug administration, while simultaneously blunting or blocking the early onset of agonist effects seen with buprenorphine alone. All active doses of buprenorphine were self-administered more than placebo, but buprenorphine/naloxone doses were not. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that intranasal buprenorphine/naloxone has deterrent properties related to transient withdrawal effects that likely decrease its desirability for misuse compared to buprenorphine in opioid-dependent individuals maintained on short-acting opioids.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Walsh SL ; Nuzzo PA ; Babalonis S ; Casselton V ; Lofwall MR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.03.005 ","Keywords":"Administration, Intranasal\r\nAdolescent\r\nAdult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid\r\nBuprenorphine/*pharmacology\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/*pharmacology\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nDouble-Blind Method\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaloxone/*pharmacology\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*pharmacology\r\nNarcotics\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nOxycodone/pharmacology\r\nReinforcement, Psychology\r\nSelf Administration\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAbuse\r\nBuprenorphine\r\nMisuse\r\nMu agonist\r\nOpioid\r\nOpioid withdrawal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Walsh SL, Nuzzo PA, Babalonis S, Casselton V, and Lofwall MR (2016) Intranasal buprenorphine alone and in combination with naloxone: Abuse liability and reinforcing efficacy in physically dependent opioid abusers..

Daily oral transmucosal formulations can be associated with misuse, diversion, and nonadherence; these limitations may be obviated by a sustained release formulation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of a novel, weekly, subcutaneous buprenorphine depot formulation, CAM2038, to block euphorigenic opioid effects and suppress opioid withdrawal in non-treatment-seeking individuals with OUD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multisite, double-blind, randomized within-patient study was conducted at 3 controlled inpatient research facilities. It involved 47 adults with DSM-V moderate-to-severe OUD. The study was conducted from October 12, 2015 (first patient enrolled), to April 21, 2016 (last patient visit). INTERVENTIONS: A total of five 3-day test sessions evaluated the response to hydromorphone (0, 6, and 18 mg intramuscular in random order; 1 dose/session/day). After the first 3-day session (ie, qualification phase), participants were randomized to either CAM2038 weekly at 24 mg (n = 22) or 32 mg (n = 25); the assigned CAM2038 dose was given twice, 1 week apart (day 0 and 7). Four sets of sessions were conducted after randomization (days 1-3, 4-6, 8-10, and 11-13). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was maximum rating on the visual analog scale for drug liking. Secondary end points included other visual analog scale (eg, high and desire to use), opioid withdrawal scales, and physiological and pharmacokinetic outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 46 of 47 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 35.5 [9] years; 76% male [n = 35]) completed the study. Both weekly CAM2038 doses produced immediate and sustained blockade of hydromorphone effects (liking maximum effect, CAM2038, 24 mg: effect size, 0.813; P < .001, and CAM2038, 32 mg: effect size, 0.753; P < .001) and suppression of withdrawal (Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, CAM2038, 24 mg: effect size, 0.617; P < .001, and CAM2038, 32 mg: effect size, 0.751; P < .001). CAM2038 produces a rapid initial rise of buprenorphine in plasma with maximum concentration around 24 hours, with an apparent half-life of 4 to 5 days and approximately 50% accumulation of trough concentration from first to second dose (trough concentration = 0.822 and 1.23 ng/mL for weeks 1 and 2, respectively, with 24 mg; trough concentration = 0.993 and 1.47 ng/mL for weeks 1 and 2, respectively, with 32 mg). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CAM2038 weekly, 24 and 32 mg, was safely tolerated and produced immediate and sustained opioid blockade and withdrawal suppression. The results support the use of this depot formulation for treatment initiation and stabilization of patients with OUD, with the further benefit of obviating the risk for misuse and diversion of daily buprenorphine while retaining its therapeutic benefits.

Many studies examining the benefits of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for opiate dependence have documented a significant reduction in both criminal behavior and the use of other opiates. Nevertheless, emerging evidence suggests that MMT may impair cognitive function. However, it is unclear as to the part methadone dose, duration of MMT or plasma level may play in any observed deficits. Given the large number of people enrolled in MMT world-wide and the potential for deficits in cognitive function, a systematic review of the research investigating the association between MMT and cognitive function seemed warranted. The following databases were searched with a combination of free-text and thesaurus terms (methadone AND cognition): MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, PsycINFO and EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Seventy-eight articles were retrieved of which 35 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of research suggests that MMT is associated with impaired cognitive function and that deficits extended across a range of domains. However, caution is required when interpreting these results due to the methodological limitations associated with many studies. Further research that includes a combination of psychological and physiological measures within well-controlled group comparison studies is required to more accurately assess which cognitive domains are affected.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang GY ; Wouldes TA ; Russell BR ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2174/18744737112059990020 ","Keywords":"Cognition/*drug effects\r\nCognition Disorders/*chemically induced\r\nDose-Response Relationship, Drug\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/adverse effects/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/rehabilitation\r\nTime Factors","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang GY, Wouldes TA, and Russell BR (2013) Methadone maintenance treatment and cognitive function: a systematic review..

We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of detoxification from opioids compared to maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid-dependent pregnant women. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to June 2017. We included randomized controlled trials or cohort studies that compared detoxification with maintenance for treating opioid-dependent pregnant women. We sought to find any studies with outcomes data for maternal abstinence at time of delivery, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), stillbirth, and preterm birth (PTB). Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-squared test for heterogeneity and the I2 test. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Harbord test. Results: Three cohort studies met inclusion criteria; these studies compared an inpatient taper to inpatient or outpatient maintenance therapy. These eligible studies included a total of 235 women with opioid use disorder in pregnancy. Maternal detoxification was associ-ated with increased risk of relapse (RRs 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5 1.14-3.21). However, no treatment differences were observed for rates of NAS (RRs50.99, 95% CI 5 0.38-2.53) or PTB (RRs 5 0.39, 95% CI 5 0.10-1.60). Conclusion: Our findings suggest there is an increased risk of relapse with detoxification compared with maintenance; however, we found detoxification does not increase the risk of PTB or NAS.

METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included four periods: induction (3-5 days), stabilization (7-21 days), randomization/treatment (6 weeks), and postmedication follow-up (1 week). A total of 442 participants with opioid dependence were enrolled; 260 were randomized to buprenorphine/naloxone or placebo. The primary outcome was retention in treatment, defined as the time from randomization to treatment completion or treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included maximum consecutive days of abstinence from opioids, self-reported craving and opioid withdrawal symptoms, and urine drug screen results. Safety assessments included adverse event reporting, electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and prior/concomitant medications. RESULTS: The median treatment retention time (95% confidence internal) with buprenorphine/naloxone was 32 days (26-38) versus 6 days (5-8) for placebo, with a Cox hazard ratio of 0.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.38; P < 0.0001). The median maximum consecutive days of abstinence (95% confidence interval) was: buprenorphine/naloxone, 21 days (26-38); placebo, 5 days (5-8) with a Cox hazard ratio of 0.38 (95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.60; P < 0.0001). Withdrawal and craving symptoms were significantly milder with buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (P < 0.001). Urine drug screen results indicated significantly lower opioid usage in the buprenorphine/naloxone group compared with placebo (P < 0.001). The most commonly reported adverse events in the buprenorphine/naloxone group during treatment were aspartate aminotransferase increased and nasopharyngitis.

This disparity raises the question of whether opioids facilitate smoking among individuals with opioid use disorder and whether opioid antagonists may reduce it. OBJECTIVES: Determine whether injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) treatment of opioid use disorder patients is associated with a spontaneous smoking reduction. We hypothesized that treatment with XR-NTX for would lead to a reduction in smoking in tobacco cigarette smokers with opioid use disorder. METHODS: We analyzed data from 64 tobacco cigarette smokers (38% female) with opioid use disorder who were induced on XR-NTX for prevention of relapse to opioids. The number of cigarettes smoked per day and opioid-related craving and withdrawal were assessed at baseline and during treatment. RESULTS: Smoking was reduced from 14.4 ± 1.0 to 9.8 ± 1.0(p < 0.001) cigarettes per day after one month and 8.6 ± 1.1 cigarettes per day after two months of treatment. Daily cigarette consumption was positively correlated with the pre-treatment frequency of opioid use and opioid-related craving during the XR-NTX treatment. CONCLUSIONS: XR-NTX treatment in smokers with opioid use disorder was associated with a 29% decline in daily cigarette consumption. Together with prior evidence of increased smoking during opioid agonist therapy, our finding suggests a pharmacodynamic interaction between nicotine and opioid systems that could influence treatment choices in this population. Our findings merit confirmation in a prospective controlled study.

However, little is known about how pharmacological treatments for OUD, for example, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), affect pain. To begin addressing this question, we performed a secondary analysis of pain data on a large prospective 24-week, open-label, randomized-controlled comparative effectiveness trial of XR-NTX versus BUP-NX (X:BOT trial). Participants' pain status was measured by the EuroQol (EQ-5D). Based on their responses to the pain question at baseline, participants were dichotomized into \"Pain\" versus \"No Pain\" categories. Participant's pain status was evaluated every 4 weeks. A mixed effects longitudinal logistic regression model was fitted to examine the differential effect of XR-NTX versus BUP-NX on pain, modelling pain at all available follow-up assessments, adjusted for age, sex, and baseline pain. A total of 474 individuals who were successfully inducted onto their assigned medications were included in this analysis. Among participants endorsing pain at baseline, substantial reductions in pain were observed over the course of the study in both treatment groups. Howecver reduction in pain was slightly greater in the group treated with XR-NTX than the one treated with BUP-NX (OR = 1.60 [95% CI: 1.07-2.40], P = 0.023). Future research using instruments and design specifically focused on pain could extend the present observations and evaluate their clinical significance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang AL ; Shulman M ; Choo TH ; Pavlicova M ; Langleben DD ; Nunes EV ; Rotrosen J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/adb.13112 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\n*Chronic Pain/drug therapy\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\nProspective Studies\r\nbuprenorphine-naloxone\r\ninjectable extended-release naltrexone\r\npain","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang AL, Shulman M, Choo TH, Pavlicova M, Langleben DD, Nunes EV, and Rotrosen J (2022) Baseline- and treatment-associated pain in the X:BOT comparative effectiveness study of extended-release naltrexone versus buprenorphine-naloxone for OUD..

This study examined the treatment effects of buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) and methadone (MET) on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score in individuals with OUD and tested whether the associations differ by sex. METHOD: We performed a secondary analysis of the data from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) protocol-0027. A total of 1269 participants (861 males and 408 females) being aged 18 or older with OUD were randomly assigned to receive BUP/NX (n = 740) or MET (n = 529). The paired t test was initially used to compare the COWS scores between pre-dose and post-dose for BUP/NX and MET treatments, separately. The linear mixed model was used to examine the changes in COWS score adjusted for baseline demographic, substance use, and mental health disorders. The interaction of sex and treatment was detected and stratified analysis by sex was conducted. RESULTS: The paired t test showed that both BUP/NX and MET treatments significantly reduced the COWS scores (p values <0.0001). BUP/NX revealed higher COWS scores than MET (p = 0.0008) and females demonstrated significantly higher COWS scores than males (p = 0.0169). Stratified by sex, BUP/NX compared with MET revealed higher COWS scores only in males (p = 0.0043), whereas baseline amphetamines use disorder and major depressive disorder were significantly associated with COWS scores in females (p = 0.0158 and 0.0422, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Both BUP/NX and MET are effective in decreasing opioid withdrawal symptoms via COWS scores, however, treatment plans for OUD by clinical providers should consider sex differences.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wang K ; Shafique S ; Xiao D ; Walter SM ; Liu Y ; Piamjariyakul U ; Xie C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/10550887.2022.2131957 ","Keywords":"Humans\r\nFemale\r\nMale\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nNaloxone/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/rehabilitation\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nSex Characteristics\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\n*Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/drug therapy\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nbuprenorphine\r\nclinical opiate withdrawal scale\r\nlinear mixed model\r\nmethadone\r\nsex differences","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wang K, Shafique S, Xiao D, Walter SM, Liu Y, Piamjariyakul U, and Xie C (2024) Repeated measures analysis of opioid use disorder treatment on clinical opiate withdrawal scale in a randomized clinical trial: sex differences..

However, not all CPGs sufficiently address all the important aspects of optimal care for managing OUD. This study aims to review current CPGs for management of OUD, evaluate their methodological quality and summarize their recommendations. METHODS: We conducted this systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). Various databases were searched for CPGs and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE-II) instrument was used to assess the methodological quality. We also summarized the treatments plans of CPGs across continuum of care (diagnosis and assessment, treatment initiation, pharmacotherapy and psychosocial). RESULTS: This review included 28 CPGs of varying qualities. CPGs from high-income countries and international organizations rated high for their methodological quality. Most CPGs scored high for the scope and purpose domain and scored low for applicability domain. Recommendations for the continuum of care for OUD varied across CPGs. Buprenorphine was recommended in most of the CPGs, followed by methadone. Recommendations for psychosocial interventions also varied, with cognitive behaviour therapies and counselling or education being the common recommendations in many CPGs WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: We found most CPGs have scope and purpose and clarity of presentation. However, the methodological rigour and applicability scored low. CPGs need to frame health questions in a comprehensible manner and provide an update as evidence grows. It is important for CPG developers to consider methodological quality as a factor when developing CPG recommendations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watan Pal A; Aziz Z ; Kamarulzaman A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jcpt.13449 ","Keywords":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/standards\r\nContinuity of Patient Care/standards\r\nHumans\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods/standards\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/diagnosis/*therapy\r\nPatient Education as Topic/standards\r\nPractice Guidelines as Topic/*standards\r\nAGREE-II instrument\r\nclinical recommendations\r\nopioid dependence\r\npractice guideline\r\npsychosocial management\r\nquality appraisal","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watan Pal A, Aziz Z, and Kamarulzaman A (2021) Methodological quality of guidelines for the management of opioid use disorder: A systematic review..

Collaborative care (CC) is effective but has not been tested for OAUD. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether CC for OAUD improves delivery of evidence-based treatments for OAUD and increases self-reported abstinence compared with usual primary care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial of 377 primary care patients with OAUD was conducted in 2 clinics in a federally qualified health center. Participants were recruited from June 3, 2014, to January 15, 2016, and followed for 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Of the 377 participants, 187 were randomized to CC and 190 were randomized to usual care; 77 (20.4%) of the participants were female, of whom 39 (20.9%) were randomized to CC and 38 (20.0%) were randomized to UC. The mean (SD) age of all respondents at baseline was 42 (12.0) years, 41(11.7) years for the CC group, and 43 (12.2) yearsfor the UC group. Collaborative care was a system-level intervention, designed to increase the delivery of either a 6-session brief psychotherapy treatment and/or medication-assisted treatment with either sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone for opioid use disorders or long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol use disorders. Usual care participants were told that the clinic provided OAUD treatment and given a number for appointment scheduling and list of community referrals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were use of any evidence-based treatment for OAUD and self-reported abstinence from opioids or alcohol at 6 months. The secondary outcomes included the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) initiation and engagement measures, abstinence from other substances, heavy drinking, health-related quality of life, and consequences from OAUD. RESULTS: At 6 months, the proportion of participants who received any OAUD treatment was higher in the CC group compared with usual care (73 [39.0%] vs 32 [16.8%]; logistic model adjusted OR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.32-6.79; P < .001). A higher proportion of CC participants reported abstinence from opioids or alcohol at 6 months (32.8% vs 22.3%); after linear probability model adjustment for covariates (β = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.23; P = .03). In secondary analyses, the proportion meeting the HEDIS initiation and engagement measures was also higher among CC participants (initiation, 31.6% vs 13.7%; adjusted OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.02-6.20; P < .001; engagement, 15.5% vs 4.2%; adjusted OR, 5.89; 95% CI, 2.43-14.32; P < .001) as was abstinence from opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, marijuana, and any alcohol (26.3% vs 15.6%; effect estimate, β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.23; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults with OAUD in primary care, the SUMMIT collaborative care intervention resulted in significantly more access to treatment and abstinence from alcohol and drugs at 6 months, than usual care.

Financial incentives, provided on the condition of treatment attendance, could address this problem. Injecting drug users are a high-risk group for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and transmission, but adherence to vaccination programmes is poor. We aimed to assess whether contingency management delivered in routine clinical practice increased the completion of HBV vaccination in individuals receiving opioid substitution therapy. METHODS: In our cluster randomised controlled trial, we enrolled participants at 12 National Health Service drug treatment services in the UK that provided opioid substitution therapy and nurse-led HBV vaccination with a super-accelerated schedule (vaccination days 0, 7, and 21). Clusters were randomly allocated 1:1:1 to provide vaccination without incentive (treatment as usual), with fixed value contingency management (three £10 vouchers), or escalating value contingency management (£5, £10, and £15 vouchers). Both contingency management schedules rewarded on-time attendance at appointments. The primary outcome was completion of clinically appropriate HBV vaccination within 28 days. We also did sensitivity analyses that examined vaccination completion with full adherence to appointment times and within a 3 month window. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN72794493. FINDINGS: Between March 16, 2011, and April 26, 2012, we enrolled 210 eligible participants. Compared with six (9%) of 67 participants treated as usual, 35 (45%) of 78 participants in the fixed value contingency management group met the primary outcome measure (odds ratio 12·1, 95% CI 3·7-39·9; p<0·0001), as did 32 (49%) of 65 participants in the escalating value contingency management group (14·0, 4·2-46·2; p<0·0001). These differences remained significant with sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Modest financial incentives delivered in routine clinical practice significantly improve adherence to, and completion of, HBV vaccination programmes in patients receiving opioid substitution therapy. Achievement of this improvement in routine clinical practice should now prompt actual implementation. Drug treatment providers should employ contingency management to promote adherence to vaccination programmes.

The study, conducted at 13 sites from June 2013 to January 2014, included a 2-day blinded induction phase and a 27-day open-label stabilization/maintenance phase. During the blinded induction, patients received fixed doses of buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving tablets or generic buprenorphine. During open-label stabilization/early maintenance, all patients received buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving tablets. The primary efficacy assessment was treatment retention at day 3; buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving tablets were considered non-inferior to generic buprenorphine if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the treatments was ≥-10% in patients retained on day 3. Secondary assessments included opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings as measured using the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale, and the opioid cravings visual analogue scale. Safety was also assessed. A total of 313 patients were randomly assigned to induction with generic buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving tablets. The mean age was 38.4 years, and the mean duration of opioid dependence was 12.4 years. For the primary efficacy assessment, 235 of 256 patients (91.8%) were retained at day 3 and continued to the maintenance phase. The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was -13.7; thus, buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving tablets did not demonstrate non-inferiority to generic buprenorphine, and significantly more patients who received induction with generic buprenorphine (122/128 [95.3%]) were retained at day 3 compared with those who received induction with buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving tablets (113/128 [88.3%]; 95% confidence interval: -13.7, -0.4; p = 0.040). The rates of clinical response, as measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale, the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale, and the visual analogue scale, were comparable among patients regardless of the induction medication.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of brief and extended buprenorphine hydrochloride-naloxone hydrochloride treatment, with different counseling intensities, for patients dependent on prescription opioids. DESIGN: Multisite, randomized clinical trial using a 2-phase adaptive treatment research design. Brief treatment (phase 1) included 2-week buprenorphine-naloxone stabilization, 2-week taper, and 8-week postmedication follow-up. Patients with successful opioid use outcomes exited the study; unsuccessful patients entered phase 2: extended (12-week) buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, 4-week taper, and 8-week postmedication follow-up. SETTING: Ten US sites. Patients A total of 653 treatment-seeking outpatients dependent on prescription opioids. INTERVENTIONS: In both phases, patients were randomized to standard medical management (SMM) or SMM plus opioid dependence counseling; all received buprenorphine-naloxone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predefined \"successful outcome\" in each phase: composite measures indicating minimal or no opioid use based on urine test-confirmed self-reports. RESULTS: During phase 1, only 6.6% (43 of 653) of patients had successful outcomes, with no difference between SMM and SMM plus opioid dependence counseling. In contrast, 49.2% (177 of 360) attained successful outcomes in phase 2 during extended buprenorphine-naloxone treatment (week 12), with no difference between counseling conditions. Success rates 8 weeks after completing the buprenorphine-naloxone taper (phase 2, week 24) dropped to 8.6% (31 of 360), again with no counseling difference. In secondary analyses, successful phase 2 outcomes were more common while taking buprenorphine-naloxone than 8 weeks after taper (49.2% [177 of 360] vs 8.6% [31 of 360], P < .001). Chronic pain did not affect opioid use outcomes; a history of ever using heroin was associated with lower phase 2 success rates while taking buprenorphine-naloxone. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription opioid-dependent patients are most likely to reduce opioid use during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment; if tapered off buprenorphine-naloxone, even after 12 weeks of treatment, the likelihood of an unsuccessful outcome is high, even in patients receiving counseling in addition to SMM.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Weiss RD ; Potter JS ; Fiellin DA ; Byrne M ; Connery HS ; Dickinson W ; Gardin J ; Griffin ML ; Gourevitch MN ; Haller DL ; Hasson AL ; Huang Z ; Jacobs P ; Kosinski AS ; Lindblad R ; McCance-Katz EF ; Provost SE ; Selzer J ; Somoza EC ; Sonne SC ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.121 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nCombined Modality Therapy\r\n*Counseling\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInterview, Psychological\r\nMale\r\nNaloxone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*therapy\r\nPsychiatric Status Rating Scales\r\nTreatment Outcome","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Weiss RD, Potter JS, Fiellin DA, Byrne M, Connery HS, Dickinson W, Gardin J, Griffin ML, Gourevitch MN, Haller DL, Hasson AL, Huang Z, Jacobs P, Kosinski AS, Lindblad R, McCance-Katz EF, Provost SE, Selzer J, Somoza EC, Sonne SC, and Ling W (2011) Adjunctive counseling during brief and extended buprenorphine-naloxone treatment for prescription opioid dependence: a 2-phase randomized controlled trial..

Although drug treatment may reduce these negative consequences, for many patients, options are limited. Buprenorphine/naloxone, an opioid agonist treatment that can be prescribed in the United States in office-based settings, can be used to expand treatment capacity and integrate substance abuse services into HIV care. Recognizing this potential, the US Health Resources and Services Administration funded the development and implementation of demonstration projects that integrated HIV care and buprenorphine/naloxone treatment at 10 sites across the country. An Evaluation and Technical Assistance Center provided programmatic and clinical support as well as oversight for an evaluation that examined the processes for and outcomes of integrated care. The evaluation included patient-level self-report and chart abstractions as well as provider and site level data collected through surveys and in-depth interviews. Although multisite demonstrations pose implementation and evaluation challenges, our experience demonstrates that these can, in part, be addressed through ongoing communication and technical assistance as well as a comprehensive evaluation design that incorporates multiple research methods and data sources. Although limitations to evaluation findings persist, they may be balanced by the scope and \"real-world\" context of the initiative.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Weiss L ; Egan JE ; Botsko M ; Netherland J ; Fiellin DA ; Finkelstein R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/QAI.0b013e3182097426 ","Keywords":"Ambulatory Care/organization & administration\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination\r\nHIV Infections/*complications\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nMulticenter Studies as Topic/*methods\r\nNaloxone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy\r\nPilot Projects\r\nUnited States","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Weiss L, Egan JE, Botsko M, Netherland J, Fiellin DA, and Finkelstein R (2011) The BHIVES collaborative: organization and evaluation of a multisite demonstration of integrated buprenorphine/naloxone and HIV treatment..

The current study examined outcomes over 42 months in the Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study (POATS). METHODS: POATS was a multi-site clinical trial lasting up to 9 months, examining different durations of buprenorphine-naloxone plus standard medical management for prescription opioid dependence, with participants randomized to receive or not receive additional opioid drug counseling. A subset of participants (N=375 of 653) enrolled in a follow-up study. Telephone interviews were administered approximately 18, 30, and 42 months after main-trial enrollment. Comparison of baseline characteristics by follow-up participation suggested few differences. RESULTS: At Month 42, much improvement was seen: 31.7% were abstinent from opioids and not on agonist therapy; 29.4% were receiving opioid agonist therapy, but met no symptom criteria for current opioid dependence; 7.5% were using illicit opioids while on agonist therapy; and the remaining 31.4% were using opioids without agonist therapy. Participants reporting a lifetime history of heroin use at baseline were more likely to meet DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence at Month 42 (OR=4.56, 95% CI=1.29-16.04, p<.05). Engagement in agonist therapy was associated with a greater likelihood of illicit-opioid abstinence. Eight percent (n=27/338) used heroin for the first time during follow-up; 10.1% reported first-time injection heroin use. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes for those dependent on prescription opioids demonstrated clear improvement from baseline. However, a subset exhibited a worsening course, by initiating heroin use and/or injection opioid use.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Weiss RD ; Potter JS ; Griffin ML ; Provost SE ; Fitzmaurice GM ; McDermott KA ; Srisarajivakul EN ; Dodd DR ; Dreifuss JA ; McHugh RK ; Carroll KM ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.02.030 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBehavior, Addictive/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy\r\n*Counseling\r\nFemale\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nYoung Adult\r\nAddiction\r\nFollow-up\r\nHeroin\r\nOpioids\r\nPrescription opioids\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Weiss RD, Potter JS, Griffin ML, Provost SE, Fitzmaurice GM, McDermott KA, Srisarajivakul EN, Dodd DR, Dreifuss JA, McHugh RK, and Carroll KM (2015) Long-term outcomes from the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study..

Methods: Thirty HIV-infected prisoners meeting DSM-IV pre-incarceration criteria for opioid dependence were enrolled in a prison-based, pre-release MMT program in Klang Valley, Malaysia; 3 died before release from prison leaving 27 evaluable participants. Beginning 4 months before release, standardized methadone initiation and dose escalation procedures began with 5. mg daily for the first week and 5. mg/daily increases weekly until 80. mg/day or craving was satisfied. Participants were followed for 12 months post-release at a MMT clinic within 25 kilometers of the prison.

We have previously described our use of telemedicine for toxicology encounters including billing and reimbursement data. These encounters involved diagnosis and disease management in poisoning, triage and clearance support, antidote administration, and assistance with opioid withdrawal. In this abstract we describe our use of telemedicine to treat opiate withdrawal and to remotely support buprenorphine induction in the ED and hospital setting. Methods: Toxicology telemedicine support consisted of ZoomVR Meeting software utilized in conjunction with a password-protected and encrypted IPad for the toxicologist and similar hardware and software platform where the patient was located. Telemedicine encounters involved use of on-call toxicology residents (rotating Emergency Medicine residents) assisting from the bedside of the patient. The actual consultation was performed utilizing a real-time audio/video connection with the assistance of the rotator who held the camera and relayed information during the exam. Telemedicine was initiated based on the toxicologist's discretion and when they were otherwise unavailable bedside (e.g. while traveling) but could perform the encounter remotely. In the case of buprenorphine induction it was also performed when the ED provider reported unfamiliarity with buprenorphine and requested advice on withdrawal management and induction dosing. Results: From January, 2017 to December, 2017 three patients (2 male/1 female; 24-35 years) received toxicology consultation via telemedicine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. IVDU-associated cellulitis, general complaint of opiate withdrawal and request for help getting into chemical dependency treatment, and fever with generalized weakness, later diagnosed as caused by IVDU-associated endocarditis, were the reasons for presentation. In each case patient's were interviewed, examined and opiate dependence and degree of withdrawal was determined via telemedicine. Two of the three were immediately treated with buprenorphine; the 3rd had buprenorphine induction the following morning as an opioid had previously been administered in the ED. Initial buprenorphine/naloxone dosing was 2/ 0.5mg followed by 8/2mg continued BID for 2 patients and 1=2 QID for one. Two individuals were subsequently seen bedside and bridged with buprenorphine to ongoing treatment after hospital care. Discussion: We previously described telemedicine reimbursement rates of $203/h. In addition to reimbursement telemedicine represents opportunity to extend medical experience and skill to underserved settings. It has been proposed to support opiate dependent patients in rural areas, which often lack enough X-waivered physicians experienced in addiction treatment. Based on our experience it can also be used to remotely support these patients in ED or hospital settings when the toxicologist is not available for direct bedside care. This may be of particular importance as visits from opiaterelated complications, including overdose, continue to rise. Conclusion: Telemedicine was performed using simple and accessible technology and software platforms which allowed for reimbursed consultation when the toxicologist was not available for bedside care. The initiation and management of buprenorphine for patients in the ED and hospital setting may be a particularly useful and important example of the use of telemedicine for extending Medical Toxicology practice.","Comments":"2018-11-02","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wiegand T ; Crane P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/15563650.2018.1506610","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nbuprenorphine plus naloxone\r\nopiate\r\nadult\r\nasthenia\r\ncase report\r\ncellulitis\r\nclinical article\r\ncomplication\r\nconference abstract\r\nconsultation\r\ndiagnosis\r\ndrug overdose\r\ndrug therapy\r\ndrug withdrawal\r\nemergency medicine\r\nemergency ward\r\nendocarditis\r\nfemale\r\nfever\r\nhospital care\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\nopiate addiction\r\nreimbursement\r\nresident\r\nrural area\r\nskill\r\nsoftware\r\ntablet computer\r\ntelemedicine\r\ntoxicology\r\ntravel\r\nvideorecording","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wiegand T, and Crane P (2018) Buprenorphine Induction Via Telemedicine to Emergency Department Patients.

METHODS: We (1) conducted a systematic review of published literature on MAT discontinuation (methadone and buprenorphine) in pregnant and postpartum women and (2) determined methadone discontinuation rates in a retrospective cohort (2006-2013) of pregnant and postpartum women in a university affiliated methadone clinic. RESULTS: We found limited generalizable literature reports of discontinuation rates, with a range of prenatal discontinuation rates from 0 to 33% and rates which spanned various prenatal and postnatal periods from 26 to 64%. In our cohort of 229 women, 251 pregnancies were reported, with a prenatal methadone discontinuation rate of 11.0%. Based on a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for age, pregnancy outcome, and duration of treatment prior to delivery, the probability of methadone discontinuation at or before 6 months postpartum was 56.0%. Duration of methadone treatment prior to delivery was inversely associated with risk for postpartum discontinuation of treatment (HR = 0.98, 95% CI (0.96, 0.99)). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the postpartum period is a time of increased risk for discontinuation of MAT. More accurate assessment of rates of pre- and postpartum MAT discontinuation, as well as further investigation of factors affecting these rates, is warranted. Development and testing of interventions to encourage early prenatal enrollment in MAT and improve postnatal retention in MAT would benefit pregnant women and new mothers with opioid use disorder.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilder C ; Lewis D ; Winhusen T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.02.012 ","Keywords":"Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nKaplan-Meier Estimate\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/therapeutic use\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*drug therapy\r\nPatient Dropouts/*statistics & numerical data\r\n*Postpartum Period\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy\r\nPregnancy Outcome\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nMedication assisted treatment\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nPatient dropout\r\nPostpartum\r\nPregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilder C, Lewis D, and Winhusen T (2015) Medication assisted treatment discontinuation in pregnant and postpartum women with opioid use disorder..

An interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of opioid use disorder during pregnancy is most effective. Ideally, obstetric and substance use treatment are co-located and ancillary support services are readily available. Medication-assisted treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is intrinsic to evidence-based care for the opioid-using pregnant woman. Women who are not stabilized on an opioid maintenance medication experience high rates of relapse and worse outcomes. Methadone has been the mainstay of maintenance treatment for nearly 50 years, but recent research has found that both methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments significantly improve maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes. Although methadone remains the current standard of care, the field is beginning to move towards buprenorphine maintenance as a first-line treatment for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, because of its greater availability and evidence of better neonatal outcomes than methadone. However, there is some evidence that treatment dropout may be greater with buprenorphine relative to methadone.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilder CM ; Winhusen T ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s40263-015-0273-8 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects\r\nAnimals\r\nBuprenorphine/administration & dosage\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMethadone/administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/complications/*drug therapy\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilder CM, and Winhusen T (2015) Pharmacological Management of Opioid Use Disorder in Pregnant Women..

Accurately identifying and treating sleep problems in this growing population has the potential to improve comorbidity and other MOUD outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of sleep in individuals stabilized on MOUD. Specifically, the following aspects of sleep were reviewed: 1) prevalence of clinically significant sleep disturbance; 2) sleep disturbance compared to findings in those not prescribed MOUD; 3) correlates of sleep disturbance; 4) self-reported sleep compared to objective measures. METHOD: Studies were identified using 6 large databases and included if they contained at least one measure of sleep during MOUD treatment as usual. Studies were excluded if they were case studies, not available in English, or participants were in withdrawal or detoxification. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were included and categorized by type of sleep assessment: validated self-report questionnaire; provider-assessed; polysomnography; multi-method. Correlates were included if they were statistically significant (generally p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates there is a high prevalence of chronic self-reported sleep disturbance (eg, insomnia symptoms) in this population and suggests quantitative sleep parameters (eg, total sleep time) and respiratory problems during sleep are worse than in the general population. These sleep problems are correlated with psychiatric comorbidity and other substance use. Other correlates (eg, sociodemographic factors) require further study to draw definitive conclusions.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilkerson AK ; McRae-Clark AL ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.sleep.2021.05.021 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nComorbidity\r\nHumans\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nSelf Report\r\nSleep\r\n*Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology\r\nAddiction\r\nAssessment\r\nMedication assisted treatment\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nSleep","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilkerson AK, and McRae-Clark AL (2021) A review of sleep disturbance in adults prescribed medications for opioid use disorder: potential treatment targets for a highly prevalent, chronic problem..

The parent study was a three-group randomized clinical trial in which participants received drug abuse counseling in prison and were randomly assigned to: (1) passive referral to substance abuse treatment upon release; (2) guaranteed methadone treatment admission upon release; and (3) methadone in prison and guaranteed continuation of methadone upon release. METHODS: Participants were 211 adult males with preincarceration histories of opiate dependence. The AIDS Risk Assessment was administered at baseline (in prison) and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month postrelease. Data were analyzed for the entire sample (N = 211) as well as the subsamples who reported injecting drugs in the 30 days prior to incarceration (n = 131) and who reported having unprotected sex in that time frame (n = 144) using generalized linear mixed model on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in sex- or drug-risk by Condition over Time. There were significant Time and Condition main effects for the total sample as well as the injector subsample for drug-risk behaviors. There were no significant Condition main effects for HIV sex-risk behaviors, but there were significant Time main effects. CONCLUSIONS: Methadone initiated in prison or immediately postrelease is associated with reduced HIV drug-risk compared to counseling in prison without methadone and passive referral to treatment at release. Participation in several drug- and sex-risk behaviors also showed significant declines during the postrelease time periods.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilson ME ; Kinlock TW ; Gordon MS ; O'Grady KE ; Schwartz RP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/j.1521-0391.2012.00250.x ","Keywords":"Adult\r\n*HIV Infections\r\nHumans\r\nLinear Models\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotics/*therapeutic use\r\nNeedle Sharing/statistics & numerical data\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*therapy\r\n*Prisoners\r\n*Risk Reduction Behavior\r\nUnited States\r\nUnsafe Sex/statistics & numerical data","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilson ME, Kinlock TW, Gordon MS, O'Grady KE, and Schwartz RP (2012) Postprison release HIV-risk behaviors in a randomized trial of methadone treatment for prisoners..

RESULTS: The 19 included articles report high levels of GP concern regarding opioid diversion, inappropriate use, abuse, misuse, diversion, dependence and addiction. Confidence screening and detecting pOUD is mixed, and few screen systematically. The most common response is declining to prescribe rather than diagnosing and managing pOUD. DISCUSSION: GPs experience high levels of conflict when considering potential pOUD in their patients with chronic pain prescribed opioids. Their experiences diagnosing and managing pOUD are not fully understood. Further theory-based research may help to understand this and assist future policy directions, programs and research priorities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wilson H ; Harris-Roxas B ; Lintzeris N ; Harris M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.31128/AJGP-10-21-6201 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects\r\n*Chronic Pain/drug therapy\r\nDrug Prescriptions\r\n*General Practitioners\r\nHumans\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wilson H, Harris-Roxas B, Lintzeris N, and Harris M (2022) Diagnosing and managing patients with chronic pain who develop prescription opioid use disorder: A scoping review of general practitioners' experience..

OBJECTIVES: Determine if administering extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX) before release (BR) from prison results in less relapse within the first three months after release than when offered by referral after release (AR). METHODS: The study randomized 1:1 persons who had an OUD, expressed interest in XR-NTX, and met study admission criteria to receive XR-NTX BR or at a local program AR, with continued medication and counseling available at that program. RESULTS: Four-hundred and two persons expressed interest in the study, 222 consented, and the study randomized 146. Uncertainty about release dates resulted in a time lag between randomization and final disposition during which 60 of the randomized patients were sentenced to other facilities, withdrew consent, or became otherwise unavailable for study treatment, leaving 86 for outcome analyses (38, BR; 48 AR). Missed follow-up appointments on the remaining 86 led to development of a phone-based questionnaire to determine presence/absence of relapse. Using it to supplement other data, we were able to confirm relapse or nonrelapse for 63 of the 86 (73%). All BR and a third of the AR patients received their first XR-NTX dose, however dropout was high and nonrelapse by month three was not significantly different between BR (39.5%) and AR (25%) (Chisq (2) = 3.23, p = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS: BR patients were much more likely to receive medication and its extended relapse and overdose protection effects in the first weeks after release. Dropout was high and the study detected no significant difference in relapse by month 3; however, the less-than-planned number of patients and missing data make this finding inconclusive.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Woody GE ; Poole S ; Yu E ; Carroll J ; Lynch KG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108355 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\nDelayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nInjections, Intramuscular\r\nNaltrexone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy\r\n*Prisoners\r\nPrisons\r\nNaltrexone\r\nOpioids\r\nPrisoners\r\nTreatment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Woody GE, Poole S, Yu E, Carroll J, and Lynch KG (2021) Extended release injectable naltrexone before vs. after release: A randomized trial of opioid addicted persons who are in prison..

In UK prisons, drug users are nearly universally treated for their opiate use by primary care clinicians, and once released access GP services where 40% of practices now treat drug users. There is a paucity of evidence evaluating methadone and buprenorphine (the two most commonly prescribed agents in the UK) for opiate detoxification. AIM: To evaluate whether buprenorphine or methadone help to achieve drug abstinence at completion of a reducing regimen for heroin users presenting to UK prison health care for detoxification. DESIGN: Open-label, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial in three prison primary healthcare departments in the north of England. METHOD: Prisoners (n = 306) using illicit opiates were recruited and given daily sublingual buprenorphine or oral methadone, in the context of routine care, over a standard reduced regimen of not more than 20 days. The primary outcome measure was abstinence from illicit opiates at 8 days post detoxification, as indicated by urine test (self-report/clinical notes where urine sample was not feasible). Secondary outcomes were also recorded. RESULTS: Abstinence was ascertained for 73.7% at 8 days post detoxification (urine sample = 52.6%, self report = 15.2%, clinical notes = 5.9%). There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of achieving abstinence between methadone and buprenorphine (odds ratio [OR] = 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81 to 3.51; P = 0.163). Abstinence was associated solely with whether or not the participant was still in prison at that time (15.22 times the odds; 95% CI = 4.19 to 55.28). The strongest association for lasting abstinence was abstinence at an earlier time point. CONCLUSION: There is equal clinical effectiveness between methadone and buprenorphine in achieving abstinence from opiates at 8 days post detoxification within prison.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wright NM ; Sheard L ; Adams CE ; Rushforth BJ ; Harrison W ; Bound N ; Hart R ; Tompkins CN ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3399/bjgp11X613106 ","Keywords":"Administration, Oral\r\nAdministration, Sublingual\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nBuprenorphine/*administration & dosage\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/*administration & dosage\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*administration & dosage\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nPrisoners/statistics & numerical data\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wright NM, Sheard L, Adams CE, Rushforth BJ, Harrison W, Bound N, Hart R, and Tompkins CN (2011) Comparison of methadone and buprenorphine for opiate detoxification (LEEDS trial): a randomised controlled trial..

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, single-arm, open-label feasibility trial. SETTING: Three office-based buprenorphine treatment (OBBT) clinics and three community pharmacies in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Six physicians, six pharmacists, and 71 patients aged ≥18 years with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) OUD on buprenorphine maintenance. INTERVENTION: After screening, eligible patients' buprenorphine care was transferred from their OBBT physician to a community pharmacist for 6 months.

This pilot study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week, transdiagnostic group therapy (mindfulness and modification therapy [MMT]) tailored for opioid-dependent individuals (N = 6) with SMI and illicit drug use. Retention was 83%. At posttreatment and 2-month follow-up, participants rated the treatment as highly helpful (9 of 10; 8.67 of 10, respectively), reported routinely practicing the guided-mindfulness exercises, and reported high confidence that they would continue to practice. Assessments revealed clinically meaningful decreases in reported days of illicit drug use at posttreatment and follow-up, with large effect sizes.

Methods The Phase I trial enrolled 36 healthy participants in two panels (A, B). In Panel A, 24 subjects were randomly assigned to the high-dosage group (400 mg naltrexone, n = 6; placebo, n = 6) or low-dosage group (200 mg naltrexone, n = 6; placebo, n = 6). In Panel B, 12 subjects were randomized to take six doses of monthly injectable naltrexone (400 mg) or placebo. Results After a single injection of naltrexone 200 and 400 mg, means (SD) of naltrexone plasma concentrations were.57 (.28) ng/ml and 1.5 (.8) ng/ml 30 days post-injection. There was no effect of accumulation after multiple dosing. Eleven of 30 subjects (36.67%) who were administered injectable depot naltrexone reported a total of 12 adverse events (AEs). Seven of these 11 AEs were coded as possibly related with study medication. All treatment-related AEs were mild in severity. No serious treatment-related AEs occurred. Discussion and Conclusions This long-acting formulation of injectable depot naltrexone is well tolerated, results in constant plasma concentration of naltrexone for at least 1 month.

However, of the many adverse events reported, sexual dysfunction is one of the most common side effects. Aim: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among male patients on methadone and buprenorphine treatments. Methods: Relevant studies published from inception until December 2012 were identified by searching PubMed, OVID, and Embase. Studies were selected using prior defined criteria. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and odds ratio were assessed thoroughly. Main Outcome Measures: To examine the prevalence and odds ratio of sexual dysfunctions among the methadone and buprenorphine groups. Results: A total of 1,570 participants from 16 eligible studies were identified in this meta-analysis. The studies provided prevalence estimates for sexual dysfunction among methadone users with a meta-analytical pooled prevalence of 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.65). Only four studies compared sexual dysfunction between the two groups, with a significantly higher combined odds ratio in the methadone group (OR=4.01, 95% CI, 1.52-10.55, P=0.0049). Conclusions: Evidence showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction was higher among the users of methadone compared with buprenorphine. Patients with sexual difficulty while on methadone treatment were advised to switch to buprenorphine. © 2013 International Society for Sexual Medicine.","Comments":"2020-10-23","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yee A ; Loh H S; Hisham Hashim ; H M B; Ng C G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/jsm.12352","Keywords":"buprenorphine\r\nmethadone\r\narticle\r\nbuprenorphine treatment\r\ndrug dependence treatment\r\nhuman\r\nmale sexual dysfunction\r\nmeta analysis\r\nmethadone treatment\r\npriority journal\r\nrisk\r\nsexual dysfunction\r\nsystematic review","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yee A, Loh H S, Hisham Hashim, H M B, and Ng C G (2014) The Prevalence of Sexual Dysfunction among Male Patients on Methadone and Buprenorphine Treatments: A Meta-Analysis Study.

However, naltrexone treatment of opioid-dependent patients may reduce striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability and cause depression and anhedonia. Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate changes in striatal DAT availability and symptoms of depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)) and anhedonia (Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)) before and during XRNT treatment. Methods: At baseline, ten detoxified heroin-dependent patients and 11 matched healthy controls underwent [<sup>123</sup>I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to assess striatal DAT binding. Patients underwent a second SPECT scan 2 weeks after an intramuscular injection with XRNT. Results: At baseline, the mean binding potential (BP<inf>ND</inf>) in the putamen was at a trend level lower and the mean BDI score was significantly higher in heroin patients (n=10) than in controls (n=11) (3.45±0.88 vs. 3.80±0.61, p=0.067, d=-0.48 and 12.75±7.40 vs. 5.20±4.83, p=0.019, d=1.24, respectively). Post hoc analyses in subgroups with negative urine analyses for opioids and cocaine showed significantly lower baseline putamen BP<inf>ND</inf> in heroin patients (n=8) than controls (n=10) (3.19±0.43 vs. 3.80±0.64, p=0.049, d=-1.03). XRNT treatment in heroin patients was not significantly associated with changes in striatal DAT availability (p=0.348, d=0.48), but the mean BDI score after XRNT treatment was significantly lower than before treatment (7.75±7.21 vs. 12.75±7.40, p=0.004, d=-0.68). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that XRNT treatment does not reduce striatal DAT availability and has no significant effect on anhedonia, but is associated with a significant reduction of depressive symptoms.","Comments":"2015-07-06","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zaaijer E R; Van Dijk L ; De Bruin K ; Goudriaan A E; Lammers L A; Koeter M W.J; Van Den Brink W ; Booij J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/s00213-015-3891-4","Keywords":"6 beta naltrexol\r\ncocaine\r\ndopamine transporter\r\niodine 123\r\nnaltrexone\r\nopiate\r\nunclassified drug\r\nadult\r\nanhedonia\r\narticle\r\nBeck Depression Inventory\r\nbinding affinity\r\nclinical article\r\ncomparative study\r\ncontrolled study\r\ndepression\r\ndetoxification\r\ndisease association\r\ndrug blood level\r\ndrug effect\r\ndrug metabolism\r\ndrug release\r\nfemale\r\nheroin dependence\r\nhuman\r\nmale\r\npost hoc analysis\r\npriority journal\r\npsychometry\r\nputamen\r\nsingle photon emission computed tomography\r\nSnaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale\r\nstriate cortex\r\nsymptomatology\r\ntreatment duration\r\nurinalysis\r\nvivitrol","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zaaijer E R, Van Dijk L, De Bruin K, Goudriaan A E, Lammers L A, Koeter M W.J, Van Den Brink W, and Booij J (2015) Effect of extended-release naltrexone on striatal dopamine transporter availability, depression and anhedonia in heroin-dependent patients.

Large interindividual variability in serum methadone levels for therapeutic response has been reported. Genetic variations in ABCB1 gene may be responsible for the variability in observed methadone concentrations. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the associations of ABCB1 polymorphisms and serum methadone concentration over the 24-hour dosing interval in opioid-dependent patients on methadone maintenance therapy (MMT). METHODS: One hundred and forty-eight male opioid-dependent patients receiving MMT were recruited. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from whole blood and genotyped for ABCB1 polymorphisms [i.e. 1236C>T (dbSNP rs1128503), 2677G>T/A (dbSNP rs2032582), and 3435C>T (dbSNP rs1045642)] using the allelic discrimination real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after the dose. Serum methadone concentrations were measured using the Methadone ELISA Kit. RESULTS: Our results revealed an association of CGC/TTT diplotype (1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, and 3435C>T) with dose-adjusted serum methadone concentration over the 24-hour dosing interval. Patients with CGC/TTT diplotype had 32.9% higher dose-adjusted serum methadone concentration over the 24-hour dosing interval when compared with those without the diplotype [mean (SD) = 8.12 (0.84) and 6.11 (0.41) ng ml(-1) mg(-1), respectively; p = 0.033]. CONCLUSION: There was an association between the CGC/TTT diplotype of ABCB1 polymorphisms and serum methadone concentration over the 24-hour dosing interval among patients on MMT. Genotyping of ABCB1 among opioid-dependent patients on MMT may help individualize and optimize methadone substitution treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zahari Z ; Lee CS ; Ibrahim MA ; Musa N ; Mohd Yasin MA; Lee YY ; Tan SC ; Mohamad N ; Ismail R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3109/00952990.2016.1172078 ","Keywords":"ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics\r\nAdult\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\nGenotype\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*blood/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\n*Opiate Substitution Treatment\r\nPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics\r\nABCB1\r\nMDR1\r\nP-glycoprotein (P-gp)\r\nmethadone maintenance therapy (MMT)\r\nopioid dependence\r\nserum methadone concentration","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zahari Z, Lee CS, Ibrahim MA, Musa N, Mohd Yasin MA, Lee YY, Tan SC, Mohamad N, and Ismail R (2016) Relationship between ABCB1 polymorphisms and serum methadone concentration in patients undergoing methadone maintenance therapy (MMT)..

Naltrexone is a non-selective opioid antagonist that can be utilized for maintenance therapy in opioid dependency. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the effects of naltrexone on retention in treatment and being opioid-free. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE databases up to February 5, 2022, using the following keywords: “Naltrexone,” “Substance abuse,” “Drug abuse,” “Opiate-related disorder,” and “Opioid dependence.” Studies that included opiate-dependent individuals who were treated with naltrexone and assessed retention in treatment or being opioid-free were included. Two authors independently used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for quality assessment. A random effect model in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used for the conduction of the meta-analysis. We performed subgroup analysis to evaluate the effects of naltrexone types on outcomes. Results: Eighteen studies, including 2,280 participants met our inclusion criteria. The duration of treatment ranged from 21 days to 24 months. The retention in treatment with naltrexone was 63% higher than controls (odds ratio (OR): 1.64 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78–3.44]. The OR for being opioid-free was 1.63 (95% CI, 0.57–4.72). Injectable naltrexone was significantly effective on retention in treatment (OR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.17–2.98).

While several interventions for OUD initiated during incarceration have been studied, few have had an economic evaluation. As part of a three-group randomized trial, we estimated the cost and cost-effectiveness of a negative urine opioid test. Detainees were assigned to interim methadone (IM) in jail with continued methadone treatment post-release with and without 3 months of post-release patient navigation (PN) compared to an enhanced treatment-as-usual group. METHODS: We implemented a micro-costing approach from the provider's perspective to estimate the cost per participant in jail and over the 12 months post-release from jail. Economic data included jail-based and community-based service utilization, self-reported healthcare utilization and justice system involvement, and administrative arrest records. Our outcome measure is the number of participants with a negative opioid urine test at their 12-month follow-up. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for intervention costs only and costs from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The average cost of providing patient navigation services per individual beginning in jail and continuing in the community was $283. We find that IM is dominated by ETAU and IM + PN. Per additional participant with a negative opioid urine test, the ICER for IM + PN including intervention costs only is $91 and $305 including societal costs. CONCLUSIONS: IM + PN is almost certainly the cost-effective choice from both an intervention provider and societal perspective.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zarkin GA ; Orme S ; Dunlap LJ ; Kelly SM ; Mitchell SG ; O'Grady KE ; Schwartz RP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108292 ","Keywords":"Adult\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/economics/therapeutic use\r\n*Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods\r\nFemale\r\nHumans\r\nJails/*economics\r\nMale\r\nMethadone/*economics/therapeutic use\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/*economics/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*economics\r\nPatient Acceptance of Health Care\r\nPatient Navigation/*economics/methods\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nCost-effectiveness\r\nJail-Based\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioids\r\nPatient navigation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zarkin GA, Orme S, Dunlap LJ, Kelly SM, Mitchell SG, O'Grady KE, and Schwartz RP (2020) Cost and cost-effectiveness of interim methadone treatment and patient navigation initiated in jail..

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library from inception to February 2015 for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational cohort studies (OBS) that compared buprenorphine with methadone for treating opioid-dependent pregnant women. Two reviewers assessed independently the titles and abstracts of all search results and full texts of potentially eligible studies reporting original data for maternal/fetal/infant death, preterm birth, fetal growth outcomes, fetal/congenital anomalies, fetal/child neurodevelopment and/or maternal adverse events. We ascertained each study's risk of bias using validated instruments and assessed the strength of evidence for each outcome using established methods. We computed effect sizes using random-effects models for each outcome with two or more studies. RESULTS: Three RCTs (n = 223) and 15 cohort OBSs (n = 1923) met inclusion criteria. In meta-analyses using unadjusted data and methadone as comparator, buprenorphine was associated with lower risk of preterm birth [RCT risk ratio (RR) = 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.18, 0.91; OBS RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.50, 0.90], greater birth weight [RCT weighted mean difference (WMD) = 277 g, 95% CI = 104, 450; OBS WMD = 265 g, 95% CI = 196, 335] and larger head circumference [RCT WMD = 0.90 cm, 95% CI = 0.14, 1.66; OBS WMD = 0.68 cm, 95% CI = 0.41, 0.94]. No treatment differences were observed for spontaneous fetal death, fetal/congenital anomalies and other fetal growth measures, although the power to detect such differences may be inadequate due to small sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately strong evidence indicates lower risk of preterm birth, greater birth weight and larger head circumference with buprenorphine treatment of maternal opioid use disorder during pregnancy compared with methadone treatment, and no greater harms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zedler BK ; Mann AL ; Kim MM ; Amick HR ; Joyce AR ; Murrelle EL ; Jones HE ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/add.13462 ","Keywords":"Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/prevention & control\r\nAnalgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use\r\nBirth Weight/physiology\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nFemale\r\nFetal Death/prevention & control\r\nFetal Development/drug effects\r\nHumans\r\nInfant, Newborn\r\nMethadone/*therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment/methods\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nPatient Safety\r\nPregnancy\r\nPregnancy Complications/*rehabilitation\r\nPregnancy Outcome\r\nPremature Birth/prevention & control\r\nPrenatal Care/methods\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\nSudden Infant Death/prevention & control\r\nBuprenorphine\r\ndependence\r\nfetus\r\nharm\r\nmethadone\r\nopioid use disorder\r\npregnancy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zedler BK, Mann AL, Kim MM, Amick HR, Joyce AR, Murrelle EL, and Jones HE (2016) Buprenorphine compared with methadone to treat pregnant women with opioid use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of safety in the mother, fetus and child..

We examined long-term treatment experiences and outcomes by type of psychiatric disorder among participants who participated in the Starting Treatment with Agonist Replacement Therapies (START) study and its follow-up study. METHODS: We categorized the 593 participants who completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) during the START follow-up study into four mutually exclusive groups to indicate current psychiatric diagnosis: 1) bipolar disorder (BPD; n = 51), 2) major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 85), 3) anxiety disorder (AXD; n = 121), and 4) no comorbid mental disorder (NMD; n = 336). We compared participants' baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Groups with mental disorders had worse substance use outcomes and poorer psychosocial functioning than the NMD group. Participants with BPD had significantly more self-reported days using opioids (Mean: 8.6 for BPD vs. 3.4 days for NMD, p < 0.01) and heroin (Mean: 6.4 for BPD vs. 2.0 for MDD, 3.1 days for NMD, p < 0.05) in the 30 days prior to the final interview. Compared to patients without mental disorders, patients with MDD spent more time engaged with OUD pharmacotherapy during the ∼16-month period between MINI and final interview (mean: 71.6 % vs. 50.6 %; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that treatment outcomes in individuals with OUD vary by psychiatric comorbidity groups, which supports the need for mental health assessment and treatment for psychiatric conditions in the context of pharmacotherapy for patients with OUD.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhu Y ; Mooney LJ ; Yoo C ; Evans EA ; Kelleghan A ; Saxon AJ ; Curtis ME ; Hser YI ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108996 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nBuprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination/therapeutic use\r\nComorbidity\r\n*Depressive Disorder, Major\r\nFollow-Up Studies\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nBuprenorphine-naloxone\r\nMethadone\r\nOpioid use disorder\r\nProspective cohort study\r\nPsychiatric comorbidity\r\nTreatment outcomes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhu Y, Mooney LJ, Yoo C, Evans EA, Kelleghan A, Saxon AJ, Curtis ME, and Hser YI (2021) Psychiatric comorbidity and treatment outcomes in patients with opioid use disorder: Results from a multisite trial of buprenorphine-naloxone and methadone..

This report presents new findings about these factors from a study of 344 opioid-dependent men and women prospectively randomized to either buprenorphine-naloxone or clonidine in an open-label 13-day medically supervised withdrawal study. Subjects were either inpatient or outpatient in community treatment settings; however not randomized by treatment setting. Medication type (buprenorphine-naloxone versus clonidine) was the single best predictor of treatment retention and treatment success, regardless of treatment setting. Compared to the outpatient setting, the inpatient setting was associated with higher abstinence rates but similar retention rates when adjusting for medication type. Early opioid withdrawal severity mediated the relationship between medication type and treatment outcome with buprenorphine-naloxone being superior to clonidine at relieving early withdrawal symptoms. Inpatient subjects on clonidine with lower withdrawal scores at baseline did better than those with higher withdrawal scores; inpatient subjects receiving buprenorphine-naloxone did better with higher withdrawal scores at baseline than those with lower withdrawal scores. No relationship was found between treatment outcome and age, gender, race, education, employment, marital status, legal problems, baseline depression, or length/severity of drug use. Tobacco use was associated with worse opioid treatment outcomes. Severe baseline anxiety symptoms doubled treatment success. Medication type (buprenorphine-naloxone) was the most important predictor of positive outcome; however the paper also considers other clinical and policy implications of other results, including that inpatient setting predicted better outcomes and moderated medication outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ziedonis DM ; Amass L ; Steinberg M ; Woody G ; Krejci J ; Annon JJ ; Cohen AJ ; Waite-O'Brien N ; Stine SM ; McCarty D ; Reid MS ; Brown LS Jr; Maslansky R ; Winhusen T ; Babcock D ; Brigham G ; Muir J ; Orr D ; Buchan BJ ; Horton T ; Ling W ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.06.016 ","Keywords":"Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use\r\nAdult\r\nAged\r\nAnxiety/psychology\r\nBuprenorphine/*therapeutic use\r\nClonidine/*therapeutic use\r\nData Interpretation, Statistical\r\nDepression/psychology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nFemale\r\nHeroin Dependence/psychology/rehabilitation\r\nHumans\r\nMale\r\nMiddle Aged\r\nNaloxone/*therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (U.S.)\r\nOpioid-Related Disorders/*rehabilitation\r\nPrognosis\r\nSmoking/psychology\r\nSocioeconomic Factors\r\nSubstance Abuse Detection\r\nSubstance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy/psychology\r\nTreatment Outcome\r\nUnited States\r\nYoung Adult","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ziedonis DM, Amass L, Steinberg M, Woody G, Krejci J, Annon JJ, Cohen AJ, Waite-O'Brien N, Stine SM, McCarty D, Reid MS, Brown LS Jr, Maslansky R, Winhusen T, Babcock D, Brigham G, Muir J, Orr D, Buchan BJ, Horton T, and Ling W (2009) Predictors of outcome for short-term medically supervised opioid withdrawal during a randomized, multicenter trial of buprenorphine-naloxone and clonidine in the NIDA clinical trials network drug and alcohol dependence..

If symptoms could not be controlled with the predefined maximal dose of a single drug, a second drug was added. Among 143 infants recruited, 120 needed pharmacological treatment. Median length of treatment for morphine was 22 days (95% CI 18 to 33), for chlorpromazine 25 days (95% CI 21 to 34), and for phenobarbital 32 days (95% CI 27 to 38) (p = ns).

A surprising number assume buprenorphine/naloxone is primarily useful as a medication to transition off illicit opioid use, and success is partially defined by discontinuing the medication. Despite accumulating evidence that a majority of patients will need to remain on medication to preserve their gains, clinicians often have to address a patient's fervent desire to taper. Using the concept of \"recovery capital,\" our review addresses (1) the appropriate duration of opioid agonist treatment, (2) risks associated with discontinuing, (3) a checklist that guides the patient through self-assessment of the wisdom of discontinuing opioid agonist treatment, and (4) shared decision making about how to proceed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zweben JE ; Sorensen JL ; Shingle M ; Blazes CK ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1097/ADM.0000000000000789 ","Keywords":"Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use\r\n*Buprenorphine/therapeutic use\r\nHumans\r\nMethadone/therapeutic use\r\nNarcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use\r\nOpiate Substitution Treatment\r\n*Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zweben JE, Sorensen JL, Shingle M, and Blazes CK (2021) Discontinuing Methadone and Buprenorphine: A Review and Clinical Challenges..
